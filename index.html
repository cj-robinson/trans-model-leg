Robinson</a></p> <div><!----><p>An imminent Supreme Court decision stands to dictate whether the state can legally enforce H.B. 500. The court's ruling may determine enforcement in Florida, Montana, Arizona and six other states whose laws draw on identical language.</p><p>How the law was written is no mystery. Representative Barbara Ehardt, who introduced the bill, didn't author it. Instead, Ehardt reached out to the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a prominent right-wing legal organization, for assistance.</p><p>“I couldn’t get the language correct,” Ehardt told <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/transgender-athlete-fight-to-heat-up-as-legislatures-return">Bloomberg Law</a>. The ADF, which the Southern Poverty Law Center designates as a hate group, provided the framework.</p><p>Constituents might expect their legislators to craft custom local-level laws, but political offices often use language sourced from think tanks or other states as the basis for introduced bills. The phenomenon is commonly referred to as model or ‘copy and paste’ legislation.</p><p>By analyzing more than 11,000 bills — using terms like ‘gender’ or ‘biological sex’ — dozens of documents were revealed as borrowing heavily from one another. Tracing them to their source finds a direct connection to model legislation promoted by advocacy groups like the ADF.</p><p>The most common type of model legislation involves bans on transgender sports participation and transgender medical care for minors. Some legislators, like Shane Jett from Oklahoma, have introduced copied bills targeting trans youth across both sports participation and medical care.</p><p>Progressive groups, including gay rights organizations such as the <a href="https://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SampleAntiConversionTherapyBill_2016-1.pdf">Human Rights Campaign</a>, also employ this technique to advance their legislative agendas. <a href="https://nationalpress.org/topic/model-bill-copycat-legislation-center-for-public-integrity-tracker/">A previous analysis</a> found that the left has been much less effective than the right in utilizing model legislation.</p><p>By August 2025, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2025">the ACLU had tracked</a> nearly 600 anti-LGBTQ bills nationwide. That number is up from 533 and 510 in 2024 and 2023, respectively, with three months left in the year.</p><!----></div> <div class="graphic-title">Anti-LGBTQ legislation significantly increased in recent years</div> <div class="graphic-sub">Number of anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in the United States, as

Most of these bills were tested out more locally and iterated on by various legislatures.</p><p>Legislating national issues at a state or city level is now allowing opponents to limit trans rights, Taylor said.</p><p>After a brief increase in so-called “bathroom bills” during 2016 and 2017, and with the Trump administration in power at the federal level, state legislation became less popular, Casey said. With Donald Trump's 2024 campaign push on anti-trans rhetoric and his presidential win, the Republican Party has now dedicated a large amount of resources and attention to the issue.</p><p>Most bills included in this analysis never progress beyond introduction or die in committee. Our analysis found that legislatures did not pass 93% of transgender sports ban bills and 90% of bans on minor medical care. That's consistent with research from the Movement Advancement Project, which found 92% of all anti-trans bills become laws at the state level.</p><p>Even if they are unsuccessful, researchers argue that this kind of legislation impacts how states function politically. Andrew Karsh, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, said these bills still take time away from committees and amendments. The legislation ultimately amounts to less time for more localized policy.</p><p>“It speaks to the fact that there's an increasing nationalization of the agenda,” said Karsh.</p><p>Methods to uncover model legislation have become more common with the rise of advanced textual analysis and large language models. Previous reporting from USA Today in their <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/03/abortion-gun-laws-stand-your-ground-model-bills-conservatives-liberal-corporate-influence-lobbyists/3162173002/">Copy, Paste, Legislate</a> project examined the scope of model legislation in aggregate.</p><!----></div> <div><!----><!----></div> <div><!----><p>The patchwork of differing state policies also leaves transgender people, particularly youth, especially vulnerable, Casey said. Research comparing states with these policies to others shows they <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/17/10641">negatively impact transgender youth’s mental health</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-023-02482-4">increase psychological distress and thoughts of suicide</a>. Studies also show the outsized effect of legislation on <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/transgender-moving-desire/">transgender people’s plans to </a><a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/transgender-moving-desire/">travel or desires</a><a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/transgender-moving-desire/"> to move.</a></p><p>The Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates that over <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/2024-anti-trans-legislation/">100,000 youth live in states that are pending bans on transgender healthcare for minors or restricting access to sports</a>.</p><p>With the Supreme Court considering Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act in Little v. Hecox and having recently ruled on a similar transgender medical care ban in Tennessee, the consequences for this vast network of laws – and the minors affected by them – are at stake</p><!----></div> <h3><!---->SAFE Act<!----></h3> <div><!----><p>The Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act aims to block medical care for transgender teens, such as puberty blockers and hormone treatments. The Family Research Council (FRC), a right-wing research and advocacy group, claims the model legislation as its own. The FRC was recently recognized as a church by the Internal Revenue Service, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/family-research-council-irs-church-status">as reported by ProPublica in 2022.</a></p><p>The act is one example of how model legislation can go from think tank to state legislatures, shifting and changing as politicians experiment with language.</p><!----></div></div> <div class="section-container svelte-auz3tn"><div class="steps-container svelte-auz3tn"><div class="spacer svelte-auz3tn"></div> <div><!--[--><div class="step svelte-auz3tn"><div class="step-content svelte-auz3tn"><!----><p>Model bills have also influenced transgender medical care for minors.</p><!----></div></div><div class="step svelte-auz3tn"><div class="step-content svelte-auz3tn"><!----><p>Arkansas, which first passed its 2021 SAFE Act after being introduced in 2021, was “largely based on FRC’s model legislation,” according to the Family Research Council’s website.</p><!----></div></div><div class="step svelte-auz3tn"><div class="step-content svelte-auz3tn"><!----><p>Evidence of the bill’s evolution is clear across multiple areas.

That law emphasizes the creation of a “private right of action,” allowing parents or guardians to sue healthcare providers, a similar method of empowering citizens rather than the government to enforce the law.</p><p>The organization posts regular updates regarding the reach of the SAFE Act across America’s legislatures, including its<a href="https://www.frc.org/statelegislativeroundup/2022-state-legislative-sessions-an-overview-on-protecting-minors-from-gender-transition#gsc.tab=0"> legislative roundup</a>, which details how the SAFE Act is “a model bill that includes all the above provisions, making it the gold standard of protection for minors.”</p><p>When the Supreme Court recently upheld Tennessee’s law in United States v. Skrmetti, it dealt a blow to transgender rights across the country by limiting access to healthcare.</p><p>Even so, <a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/06/27/appeals-court-orders-new-filings-in-arkansas-transgender-care-case-due-to-scotus-ruling/">state courts have ruled</a> that the Supreme Court’s decision does not directly apply to model legislation that heavily draws from the SAFE Act, like those in our analysis.</p><p>Differences between the two include that the SAFE Act contains a wrongful death clause not found in Tennessee’s law, and does not allow for suits to be brought against the parents of minors undergoing treatment. Those differences could insulate SAFE Act-inspired bills from some of the legal challenges pending against Tennessee’s version.</p><p>In January of 2025, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-children-from-chemical-and-surgical-mutilation/">President Trump released</a> an executive order titled “Protecting Children From Chemical And Surgical Mutilation.” The act states the United States will not “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another,” and vows to enforce state bans on procedures. A federal court issued a temporary restraining order in February.</p><p>The Trump administration is attempting to force a national ban in other ways, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5490427/bonta-trump-bondi-transgender-minors-hospital">using the Attorney General to enforce </a>laws banning female genital mutilation. <a href="https://x.com/FBI/status/1929587710894739567">The FBI posted on X</a>, asking the public to report any hospitals or doctors who may violate the action.</p><p>Outright bans on gender-affirming care for minors are dangerous for transgender youth, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-arkansas-law-and-similar-bills-endanger-transgender-youth-research-shows/">research shows</a>.</p><!----></div> <h3><!---->Fairness in Women’s Sports Act<!----></h3> <p><!----><p>In press briefings or news articles, representatives in <a href="https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2021/governor-ron-desantis-signs-fairness-womens-sports-act">three</a> <a href="https://www.counton2.com/news/lowcountry-lawmakers-discuss-save-womens-sports-act-as-it-goes-to-sc-senate/">different</a> <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/bc-conservatives-bill-for-women-only-sports-defeated-by-governing-ndp-5640623">states</a> said the same thing about bills they sponsored – it protected “opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their strength, skills, and athletic abilities.”</p><p>All the bills also shared their title and much of their content with the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, first introduced in 2019 by Idaho Rep. Ehardt.</p><p>The bill was designed to ban students who were listed as male on their birth certificates from playing on any sports designated for women. It also introduced the ability for schools to be sued by “any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect harm” from violations of the law. The “cause of action” mirrors bans on transgender medical care for minors.</p><p>Rep. Ehardt told <a href="https://missoulacurrent.com/transgender-athlete-bill/">several media </a>outlets she began researching high school sports legislation after finding that two transgender women won Idaho state track meets in 2018. After Ehardt reached out, the Alliance Defending Freedom found a previous state bill that required specific protocols for middle school sports and began drafting legislation.</p><p>Ehardt herself has traveled to other states to testify on behalf of the model legislation, which is often copied verbatim.</p><p>Over 16 states introduced legislation called the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” or used language similar to the original Idaho bill, according to our analysis. Florida also used language from the Idaho bill to amend a <a href="https://legiscan.com/FL/text/S1028/id/2386941">large education bill</a> at line 1,700.</p><p>Several changes were also made over the years as states modified the original act.</p><p>In <a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/SB165/id/2631290">Missouri’s 2023 “Save Women’s Sports Act,” </a>it explicitly denies state funding for any school not abiding by the law. It also adds a passage allowing schools to provide “alternative accommodations” to transgender students not present in the original legislation, and has no physical verification process.</p><p><a href="https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB723/id/2895660">Virginia’s 2025 bill</a> introduces stricter language. Rather than requiring “reproductive anatomy, genetic makeup, or normal endogenously produced testosterone levels,” like in the original Idaho bill, they require all three tests. Virginia also does not allow a state board to resolve disputes, instead putting discretion solely in the hands of physicians.</p><p>In February 2025, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/">released another executive action</a> targeting transgender athletes and sports participation, leading to the United States Olympic Committee banning transgender participants and updates to national college sports guidelines. While active litigation against the policy is ongoing, judges have not issued any restraining orders or injunctions.</p><p>The House of Representatives also passed a bill called the “Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025,” which bears little resemblance to the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act but still amends Title IX to achieve a similar purpose.</p><p>The Alliance Defending Freedom began utilizing model legislation to target transgender people in the early 2010s as legislators introduced “bathroom bills” across the country, targeting which bathrooms transgender people could use.</p><p>Model legislation, such as the ADF’s <a href="https://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2015A/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/4f3a48ec0a54330687257de2005e3f8c/%24FILE/15HouseState0204AttachC.pdf#page=5">Student Physical Privacy Act,</a> was promoted in 2014 and adopted by several lawmakers. Sponsors of the Kansas version of this bill “thought it did a good job of being thorough and concise, so we adopted parts of it,” as reported by <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/alliance-defending-freedom-lobbies-anti-lgbt-bathroom-bills/">Mother Jones</a>.</p><!----></p> <h3><!---->Representative republications<!----></h3> <p><!----><p>Certain legislators introduced bills across several areas of transgender rights that mirrored model legislation.</p><p>In 2023, Oklahoma Representative Shane Jett introduced both the <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB1007/id/2650656">Save Men's Sports Act</a> and a copy of the <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/drafts/SB878/2023">Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act</a>.</p><p>It’s expected that certain states innovate and create policy while others look to other politicians for inspiration, Professor Karsh said.</p><p>“Some state legislatures are highly professionalized with higher salaries, they meet year-round, they have a lot of staff,” Karsh said. “Then you have other legislatures where the lawmakers are part-time and their salaries are pretty low, and they don't have staff support.”</p><p><a href="https://ehansen4.sites.luc.edu/documents/Hansen_Jansa_Complexity.pdf">Studies</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X18776628">support</a> the claim that understaffed legislatures are more likely to pull from model legislation or other legislation from around the country.</p><!----></p> <br/> <div class="graphic-title">Model Legislation is Introduced Around the Country, Often by Less
