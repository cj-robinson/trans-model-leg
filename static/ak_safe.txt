18 Subtitle
19 TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS SAVE ADOLESCENTS
20 FROM EXPERIMENTATION (SAFE) ACT.
21
22
23 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
24
25 SECTION 1. Title.
26 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Arkansas Save
27 Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act".
28
29 SECTION 2. Legislative findings.
30 The General Assembly finds that:
31 (1) Arkansas has a compelling government interest in protecting
32 the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children;
33 (2)(A) Only a small percentage of the American population
34 experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex.
35 (B) According to the American Psychiatric Association,
36 “For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for 
As Engrossed: H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570
2 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259
1 natal females, from 0.002% to 0.003%.”;
2 (3) For the small percentage of children who are gender
3 nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological
4 sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with
5 their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most
6 physiological interventions unnecessary;
7 (4) Furthermore, scientific studies show that individuals
8 struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have
9 already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should
10 be encouraged to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and
11 underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or
12 surgical intervention;
13 (5) Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender
14 reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and
15 mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population;
16 (6)(A) Some healthcare providers are prescribing puberty17 blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to
18 delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress
19 at identifying with their biological sex.
20 (B) The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being
21 done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the
22 risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or
23 gender transition;
24 (7) Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones
25 for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological
26 sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted
27 on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or
28 children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;
29 (8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known
30 risks, such as:
31 (A) For biological females:
32 (i) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red
33 blood cells;
34 (ii) Severe liver dysfunction;
35 (iii) Coronary artery disease, including heart
36 attacks;
As Engrossed: H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570
3 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259
1 (iv) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes;
2 (v) Hypertension;
3 (vi) Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers;
4 and
5 (vii) Irreversible infertility; and
6 (B) For biological males:
7 (i) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots;
8 (ii) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones;
9 (iii) Coronary artery disease, including heart
10 attacks;
11 (iv) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the
12 pituitary gland;
13 (v) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes;
14 (vi) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated
15 level of tryglycerides in the blood;
16 (vii) Breast cancer; and
17 (viii) Irreversible infertility;
18 (9) Genital and nongenital gender reassignment surgeries are
19 generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals
20 for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent;
21 (10)(A) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several
22 irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the
23 alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts.
24 (B) For biological males, surgery may involve:
25 (i) Genital reconstruction including penectomy,
26 which is the removal of the penis;
27 (ii) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the
28 testicles;
29 (iii) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a
30 vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure;
31 (iv) Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a
32 clitoris-like structure; and
33 (v) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a
34 vulva-like structure.
35 (C) For biological females, surgery may involve:
36 (i) A hysterectomy or oophorectomy;
As Engrossed: H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570
4 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259
1 (ii) Reconstruction of the urethra;
2 (iii) Genital reconstruction including
3 metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like
4 structure;
5 (iv) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the
6 vagina;
7 (v) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a
8 penis-like and scrotum-like structure; and
9 (vi) Implantation of erection or testicular
10 prostheses;
11 (11) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns
12 associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and
13 females are numerous and complex;
14 (12)(A) Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes various
15 invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or
16 removal of biologically normal and functional body parts.
17 (B) For biological males, this surgery may involve:
18 (i) Augmentation mammoplasty;
19 (ii) Facial feminization surgery;
20 (iii) Liposuction;
21 (iv) Lipofilling;
22 (v) Voice surgery;
23 (vi) Thyroid cartilage reduction;
24 (vii) Gluteal augmentation;
25 (viii) Hair reconstruction; and
26 (ix) Other aesthetic procedures.
27 (C) For biological females, this surgery may involve:
28 (i) A subcutaneous mastectomy;
29 (ii) Voice surgery;
30 (iii) Liposuction;
31 (iv) Lipofilling;
32 (v) Pectoral implants; and
33 (vi) Other aesthetic procedures;
34 (13)(A) It is an accepted principle of economics and public
35 policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for
36 that service or product is increased.
As Engrossed: H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570
5 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259
1 (B) Between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries
2 increased by nearly twenty percent (20%) in the United States;
3 (14) It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the
4 medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at
5 identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and
6 drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently
7 sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies
8 showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks;
9 and
10 (15) The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any
11 benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.
12
13 SECTION 3. Arkansas Code Title 20, Chapter 9, is amended to add an
14 additional subchapter to read as follows:
