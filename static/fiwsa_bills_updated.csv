HOUSE BILL NO. 112 1 

INTRODUCED BY J. FULLER 2 

 3 

A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT CREATING THE ""SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT""; REQUIRING 4 

PUBLIC SCHOOL ATHLETIC TEAMS TO BE DESIGNATED BASED ON BIOLOGICAL SEX; PROVIDING 5 

CERTAIN PROTECTIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; PROVIDING A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR 6 

CERTAIN VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.” 7 

 8 

WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that there are ""inherent differences between men and women"", and 9 

that these differences ""remain cause for celebration but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for 10 

artificial contracts on an individual's opportunity"", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and 11 

WHEREAS, these ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 12 

physiological differences; and 13 

WHEREAS, men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 14 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher haemoglobin"", Neel Burton, The 15 

Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); and 16 

WHEREAS, men have a higher natural level of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin 17 

levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all 18 

of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity, Doriane 19 

Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, 80 Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, 20 

Men, Women, and Speed. 2 Words: Got Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); and 21 

WHEREAS, the biological differences between males and females, especially as they relate to natural 22 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during 23 

puberty and have life-long effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different 24 

strength, speed, and endurance"", Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic 25 

Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy; and 26 

WHEREAS, while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the United States Supreme 27 

Court has recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 28 



 
  
67th Legislature  HB 112.1

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of 1 

the talent and capacities of our Nation's people"", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and 2 

WHEREAS, one place in which sex classification allows for the ""full development of the talent and 3 

capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics; and 4 

WHEREAS, courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 5 

females result in different athletic capabilities, see, e.g., Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 6 

612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly 7 

situated as they enter athletic competition."") and Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 8 

1979) (noting that high school boys generally possess physiological advantages over their girl counterparts and 9 

that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like high school track); and 10 

WHEREAS, a recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although 11 

athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the gender gap between male and female performances 12 

remained stable, which ""suggest[s] that women's performances at the high level will never match those of men"", 13 

Valerie Thibault, et al., Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 14 

Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); and 15 

WHEREAS, as Duke Law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Lambelet Coleman, tennis 16 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently wrote, ""The 17 

evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will 18 

always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head 19 

competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science"", Doriane Lambelet Coleman, et al., Pass the 20 

Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); and 21 

WHEREAS, having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality, and sex-22 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, 23 

and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college 24 

scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors. 25

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(a)<i> Legislative
findings.</i> -ย  </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(1) The Legislature
finds that there are โ��inherent differences between men and women,โ�� and that
these differences โ��remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the
members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's
opportunity,โ�� <i>United States v. Virginia</i>, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(2) These โ��inherent
differencesโ�� range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological
differences;</span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(3) Men generally have โ��denser,
stronger bones, tendons, and ligamentsโ�� and โ��larger hearts, greater lung volume
per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,โ�� Neel
Burton, <i>The Battle of the Sexes</i>, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(4) Men also have higher
natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin levels,
body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of
type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher
speed and power during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, <i>Sex in
Sport</i>, Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata,
Men, Women and Speed. <i>2 Words: Got Testosterone?</i>, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21,
2008)); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(5) The biological
differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural
levels of testosterone, โ��explain the male and female secondary sex
characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects,
including those most important for success in sport: categorically different
strength, speed, and endurance,โ�� Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve,
โ��<i>Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men</i>,โ��
Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy; </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(6) While
classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has
recognized that โ��sex classifications may be used to compensate women for
particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal
employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and
capacities of our Nation's people,โ�� <i>United States v. Virginia</i>, 518 U.S.
515, 533 (1996); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(7) One place where sex
classifications allow for the โ��full development of the talent and capacities of
our Nation's peopleโ�� is in the context of sports and athletics;</span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(8) Courts have
recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and
females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. <i>Kleczek v. Rhode
Island Interscholastic League, Inc</i>., 612 A.2d 13 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (โ��Because
of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated
as they enter athletic competition.โ��); <i>Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n</i>,
394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that โ��high school boys
[generally possess physiological advantages over] their girl counterpartsโ�� and
that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like โ��high
school trackโ��); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(9) A recent study of
female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although athletes
from both sexes improved over the time span, the โ��gender gapโ�� between female
and male performances remained stable. โ��These suggest that women's performances
at the high level will never match those of men.โ�� <i>Valerie Thibault et al.,
Women</i> and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since
1983, Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(10) As Duke Law
professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis champion
Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross
recently wrote: โ��The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every
sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant
numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head
competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,โ�� Doriane
Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., <i>Pass the Equality Act, But Don't
Abandon Title IX</i>, Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(11) The benefits that
natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the
use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of
such treatments found that even โ��after 12 months of hormonal therapy,โ�� a man
who identifies as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones โ��had an absolute
advantageโ�� over female athletes and โ��will still likely have performance
benefitsโ�� over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., โ��Muscle strength, size and
composition following months of gender-affirming treatment in transgender
individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,โ�� Karolinksa Institute
(Sept. 26, 2019); and </span></u></p>

<p class=SectionBody><u><span style='color:windowtext'>(12) Having separate
sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-specific teams
accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate
their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) The legislature finds that there are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and 2 

that these differences ""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either 3

physiological differences; 7 

(3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 8 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel 9

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team must be categorized as males, men, or boys; 2 

females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute a student may establish sex by 3 

presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, this act 4 

would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or subject 5 

to retaliation as a result of this chapter. 6

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: February 16, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these differences 2 

""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

<p>2. That the General Assembly finds that (i) there are 
 ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these

 members of either sex or artificial constraints on an individual's 
 opportunity"" (<i class=new>United States v. Virginia</i> 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)), 
 and these ""inherent differences"" range from 
 chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences, including 
 men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments,"" 
 ""larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell 
 count, and higher hemoglobin"" (Neel Burton, ""The 
 Battle of the Sexes,"" <i class=new>Psychology Today</i> 
 (July 2, 2012)), higher natural levels of 
 testosterone, which affects traits such as body fat content, the storage and 
 use of carbohydrates, and the development of type two muscle fibers, all of which 
 result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical 
 activity (Doriane Lambelet Coleman, ""Sex in 
 Sport,"" <i class=new>Law and Contemporary Problems</i> 
 63, 74 (2017)); (ii) that these biological differences between men and women 
 ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 
 during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for 
 success in sport: categorically different strength, speed and endurance"" (Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 
 Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic Performances: The 
 Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law 
 Center for Sports Law and Policy), and that while classifications based on sex 
 are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has recognized that ""sex 
 classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 
 disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, 
 [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's 
 people"" (<i class=new>United States v. Virginia</i>, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)); 
 (iii) that one place in which sex classifications allow for the ""full 
 development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the 
 context of sports and athletics (<i class=new>Id.</i>); (iv) that courts have recognized 
 that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result 
 in different athletic capabilities, as seen in <i class=new>Kleczek 
 v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc.</i>, 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992):""Because of innate physiological differences, boys 
 and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."" and in <i class=new>Petrie v. Illinois High Sch. Ass'n</i>, 
 394 N.E. 2d 855, 861 (Ill. Ct. App. 1979): finding 
 that ""high school boys [generally possess 
 physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those 
 advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high 
 school track""; (v) that a recent study of female and male Olympic 
 performances dating back to 1983 found that, although athletes of both sexes 
 improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female and male 
 performances remains stable and ""[t]h[is] suggest[s] that women's 
 performances at the high level will never match those of men"" (Valerie 
 Thibault et al., ""Women and Men in Sport 
 Performance: The Gender Gap Has Not Evolved since 1983,"" 
 <i class=new>Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine</i> 
 214, 291 (2010)); (vi) that, as Duke Law professor and All-American track 
 athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track 
 gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross wrote, ""[t]he evidence is unequivocal 
 that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, 
 there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the 
 best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are 
 simply a denial of science."" (Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et 
 al., ""Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon 
 Title IX,"" <i class=new>Washington Post</i> (Apr. 29, 
 2019)); and (vii) that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to male 
 athletes is not diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex 
 hormones. A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that even 
 ""after 12 months of hormonal therapy"" a man who identifies as a woman 
 and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over 
 female athletes and ""will still likely have performance benefits"" 
 over women (Tommy Lundberg, et al., ""Muscle strength, size and composition following 
 months of gender-affirming treatment of transgender individuals: retained 
 advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinska Institute 
 (Sept. 26, 2019)); and that the General Assembly finds that having sex-specific 
 teams provide opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, 
 strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities 
 to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous 
 other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors, and 
 that, therefore, maintaining separate sex-specific teams is imperative to 
 promoting sex equality and necessary to ensuring female athletes equal 
 protection under the law and equal treatment and opportunity in public school 
 and higher education athletics.</p>",2024-01-19,text/html,1

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: March 01, 2024 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these differences 2 

""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the ""full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that ""high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high school track""); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. ""These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men."" Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: ""The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,"" 27

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even ""after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy,"" a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over female athletes and 33

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2025.  7
