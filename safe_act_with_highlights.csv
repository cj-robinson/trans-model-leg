Subtitle 18 

TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS SAVE ADOLESCENTS 19 

FROM EXPERIMENTATION (SAFE) ACT. 20 

 21 

 22 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS: 23 

 24 

 SECTION 1.  Title. 25 

 This act shall be known and may be cited as the ""Arkansas Save 26 

Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act"". 27 

 28 

 SECTION 2.  Legislative findings. 29 

 The General Assembly finds that: 30 

  (1)  Arkansas has a compelling government interest in protecting 31 

the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children; 32 

  (2)(A)  Only a small percentage of the American population 33 

experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex.  34 

   (B)  According to the American Psychiatric Association, 35 

“For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for 36 



As Engrossed:  H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570 

 

 2 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259 

 

 

natal females, from 0.002% to 0.003%.”; 1 

  (3)  For the small percentage of children who are gender 2 

nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological 3 

sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with 4 

their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most 5 

physiological interventions unnecessary; 6 

  (4)  Furthermore, scientific studies show that individuals 7 

struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have 8 

already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should 9 

be encouraged to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and 10 

underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or 11 

surgical intervention; 12 

  (5)  Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender 13 

reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and 14 

mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population; 15 

  (6)(A)  Some healthcare providers are prescribing puberty-16 

blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to 17 

delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress 18 

at identifying with their biological sex. 19 

   (B)  The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being 20 

done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the 21 

risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or 22 

gender transition; 23 

  (7)  Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones 24 

for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological 25 

sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted 26 

on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or 27 

children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition; 28 

  (8)  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known 29 

risks, such as: 30 

   (A)  For biological females: 31 

    (i)  Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red 32 

blood cells; 33 

    (ii)  Severe liver dysfunction; 34 

    (iii)  Coronary artery disease, including heart 35 

attacks; 36 



As Engrossed:  H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570 

 

 3 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259 

 

 

    (iv)  Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; 1 

    (v)  Hypertension; 2 

    (vi)  Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers; 3 

and  4 

    (vii)  Irreversible infertility; and 5 

   (B)  For biological males: 6 

    (i)  Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; 7 

    (ii)  Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; 8 

    (iii)  Coronary artery disease, including heart 9 

attacks; 10 

    (iv)  Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the 11 

pituitary gland; 12 

    (v)  Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; 13 

    (vi)  Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated 14 

level of tryglycerides in the blood; 15 

    (vii)  Breast cancer; and  16 

    (viii)  Irreversible infertility; 17 

  (9)  Genital and nongenital gender reassignment surgeries are 18 

generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals 19 

for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent; 20 

  (10)(A)  Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several 21 

irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the 22 

alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. 23 

   (B)  For biological males, surgery may involve: 24 

    (i)  Genital reconstruction including penectomy, 25 

which is the removal of the penis; 26 

    (ii)  Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the 27 

testicles; 28 

    (iii)  Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a 29 

vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure; 30 

    (iv)  Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a 31 

clitoris-like structure; and  32 

    (v)  Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a 33 

vulva-like structure. 34 

   (C)  For biological females, surgery may involve: 35 

    (i)  A hysterectomy or oophorectomy; 36 



As Engrossed:  H3/2/21 H3/8/21 HB1570 

 

 4 03-08-2021 11:23:08 JMB259 

 

 

    (ii)  Reconstruction of the urethra; 1 

    (iii)  Genital reconstruction including 2 

metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like 3 

structure; 4 

    (iv)  Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the 5 

vagina; 6 

    (v)  Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a 7 

penis-like and scrotum-like structure; and  8 

    (vi)  Implantation of erection or testicular 9 

prostheses; 10 

  (11)  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns 11 

associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and 12 

females are numerous and complex; 13 

  (12)(A)  Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes various 14 

invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or 15 

removal of biologically normal and functional body parts. 16 

   (B)  For biological males, this surgery may involve: 17 

    (i)  Augmentation mammoplasty;  18 

    (ii)  Facial feminization surgery; 19 

    (iii)  Liposuction; 20 

    (iv)  Lipofilling; 21 

    (v)  Voice surgery; 22 

    (vi)  Thyroid cartilage reduction; 23 

    (vii)  Gluteal augmentation; 24 

    (viii)  Hair reconstruction; and  25 

    (ix)  Other aesthetic procedures.  26 

   (C)  For biological females, this surgery may involve: 27 

    (i)  A subcutaneous mastectomy; 28 

    (ii)  Voice surgery; 29 

    (iii)  Liposuction; 30 

    (iv)  Lipofilling; 31 

    (v)  Pectoral implants; and  32 

    (vi)  Other aesthetic procedures; 33 

  (13)(A)  It is an accepted principle of economics and public 34 

policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for 35

   (B)  Between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries 1 

increased by nearly twenty percent (20%) in the United States; 2 

  (14)  It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the 3 

medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at 4 

identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and 5 

drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently 6 

sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies 7 

showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; 8 

and 9 

  (15)  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any 10 

benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.  11

EXPERIMENTATION ACT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Subtitle TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS SAVE ADOLESCENTS FROM EXPERIMENTATION ACT BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS SECTION Title This act shall be known and may be cited as the Arkansas Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act SECTION Legislative findings The General Assembly finds that Arkansas has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens especially vulnerable children Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex According to the American Psychiatric Association “For natal adult males prevalence ranges from % to % and for As Engrossed H3//H3//HB150 -- JMB29 natal females from % to % ” For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary Furthermore scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures suicide rates psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population Some healthcare providers are prescribing</span> puberty-blocking <span class=""copied-language"">drugs such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks such as For biological females Erythrocytosis which is an increase in red blood cells Severe liver dysfunction Coronary artery disease including heart attacks As Engrossed H3//H3//HB150 -- JMB29 Cerebrovascular disease including strokes Hypertension Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers and Irreversible infertility and For biological males Thromboembolic disease including blood clots Cholelithiasis including gallstones Coronary artery disease including heart attacks Macroprolactinoma which is a tumor of the pituitary gland Cerebrovascular disease including strokes Hypertriglyceridemia which is an elevated level of tryglycerides in the blood Breast cancer and Irreversible infertility Genital and nongenital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts For biological males surgery may involve Genital reconstruction including penectomy which is the removal of the penis Orchiectomy which is the removal of the testicles Vaginoplasty which is the construction of a vagina-like structure typically through a penile inversion procedure Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure and Vulvoplasty which is the construction of a vulva-like structure For biological females surgery may involve A hysterectomy or oophorectomy As Engrossed H3//H3//HB150 -- JMB29 Reconstruction of the urethra Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty which is the construction of a penis-like structure Vaginectomy which is the removal of the vagina Scrotoplasty which is the construction of a penis-like and scrotum-like structure and Implantation of erection or testicular prostheses The complications risks and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts For biological males this surgery may involve Augmentation mammoplasty Facial feminization surgery Liposuction Lipofilling Voice surgery Thyroid cartilage reduction Gluteal augmentation Hair reconstruction and Other aesthetic procedures For biological females this surgery may involve A subcutaneous mastectomy Voice surgery Liposuction Lipofilling Pectoral implants and Other aesthetic procedures It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed demand for that service or product is increased As Engrossed H3//H3//HB150 -- JMB29 Between and gender

To enact sections 3129.01, 3129.02, 3129.03, 

3129.04, 3129.05, 3129.06, 3129.07, and 3129.08 

of the Revised Code to prohibit certain 

procedures to alter a minor child's sex and to 

designate this act as the Save Adolescents from 

Experimentation (SAFE) Act. 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:

Section 1. That sections 3129.01, 3129.02, 3129.03, 

3129.04, 3129.05, 3129.06, 3129.07, and 3129.08 of the Revised 

Code be enacted to read as follows:

Sec. 3129.01.   The general assembly hereby finds and   

declares all of the following:

(A) This state has a compelling government interest in 

protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially 

vulnerable children;

(B) Only a tiny percentage of the American population 

experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex.

According to the American psychiatric association, prevalence 

ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 per cent for natal adult males and 

from 0.002 to 0.003 per cent for natal females;

(C) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast 

majority of children who are gender non-conforming or experience 

distress at identifying with their biological sex come to 

identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, 

thereby rendering most medical health care interventions 

unnecessary;

(D) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling 

with distress at identifying with their biological sex often 

have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these 

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care 

services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical 

intervention;

(E) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality 

rates remain markedly elevated above the background population 

after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been 

performed;

(F) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-

blocking drugs in order to delay the onset or progression of 

normally-timed puberty in children who experience distress at 

identifying with their biological sex. This is being done 

despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies 

evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the 

treatment of such distress or gender transition;

(G) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex 

hormones for children who experience distress at identifying 

with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of 

the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the 

purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;

(H) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following 

serious known risks:

(1) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver 

dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, 

hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers, and 

irreversible infertility.

(2) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, 

cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, 

cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, 

and irreversible infertility.

(I) Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are 

generally not recommended for children, although evidence 

indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are 

becoming more frequent;

(J) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several 

irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and 

involves the following alterations of biologically normal and 

functional body parts:

(1) For biological males, surgery may involve genital 

reconstruction including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, 

clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.

(2) For biological females, surgery may involve a 

hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, 

genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, 

vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or 

testicular prostheses.

(K) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns 

associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both 

males and females are numerous and complex;

(L) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes 

various invasive procedures for males and females and also 

involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and 

functional body parts:

(1) For biological males, procedures may include 

augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, 

liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage 

reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other 

aesthetic procedures.

(2) For biological females, procedures may include 

subcutaneous mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, 

lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures.

(M) It is an accepted principle of economics and public 

policy that when a service or product is subsidized or paid for, 

demand for that service or product increases. Just between 2015 

and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by twenty per 

cent;

(N) It is of grave concern to the general assembly that 

the medical community is allowing individuals who experience 

distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects 

of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment 

surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender 

reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that 

the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks;

(O) The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh 

any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.

<p class=SEC06-17>Sec.&nbsp;2. <span class=SECHEAD>Legislative right
of intervention</span></p>

<p class=P06-00>The legislature, by joint resolution, may appoint one or more
of its members who sponsored or cosponsored this act in the member's official
capacity to intervene or defend the statute as a matter of right in any case in
which the constitutionality or enforceability of this act or any portion of
this act or any rule adopted pursuant to this act is challenged.</p>

<p class=P06-00>Sec.&nbsp;3. <span class=SECHEAD>Legislative
findings </span></p>

<p class=P06-00>The legislature finds that: </p>

<p class=P06-00>1. Arizona has a compelling governmental interest in
protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable
children.</p>

<p class=P06-00>2. Only a small percentage of the American
population experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class=P06-00>3. For the small percentage of children who are
gender-nonconforming or who experience distress at identifying with their
biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to
identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby
rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.</p>

<p class=P06-00>4. Furthermore, scientific studies show that
individuals experiencing distress at identifying with their biological sex
often experienced psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria, which
indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health
services.</p>

<p class=P06-00>5. Even among people who have undergone inpatient
gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities and
mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.</p>

<p class=P06-00>6. Some healthcare providers are prescribing
puberty-blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in
order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience
distress at identifying with their biological sex. Puberty-blocking
drugs are being prescribed despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal
studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the
treatment of such distress or gender transition. </p>

<p class=P06-00>7. Health care providers are also prescribing
cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with
their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have
been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in
adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender
transition.</p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>8. The use of
cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, such as: </p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(a) For biological
females:</p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red
blood cells. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Severe liver dysfunction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Coronary artery disease, including heart
attacks.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers. </p>

<p class=P06-00>9. Genital and nongenital gender reassignment
surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence
indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent.</p>

<p class=P06-00>10. Genital gender reassignment surgery includes
several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the
alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts, including: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) For biological males: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Genital reconstruction including penectomy,
which is the removal of the penis.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the
testicles.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a
vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a
clitoris-like structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a
vulva-like structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) For biological females: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) A hysterectomy or oophorectomy. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Reconstruction of the urethra.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Genital reconstruction including
metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like
structure.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the
vagina. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a
penis-like and scrotum-like structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Implantation of erection or testicular
prostheses.</p>

<p class=P06-00>11. The complications, risks and long-term care
concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and
females are numerous and complex.</p>

<p class=P06-00>12. Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes
various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the
alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts,
including: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) For biological males: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Augmentation mammoplasty. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Facial feminization surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Liposuction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Lipofilling. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Voice surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Thyroid cartilage reduction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vii) Gluteal augmentation.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(viii) Hair reconstruction. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ix) Other aesthetic procedures. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) For biological females: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) A subcutaneous mastectomy. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Voice surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Liposuction. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Lipofilling.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Pectoral implants. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Other aesthetic procedures.</p>

<p class=P06-00>13. It is an accepted principle of economics and
public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed,
demand for that service or product is increased. Between 2015 and
2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by nearly twenty percent in the
United States.</p>

<p class=P06-00>14. It is of grave concern to the legislature that
the medical community, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of
such extreme interventions outweigh the risks, is allowing individuals who
experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of
irreversible and drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and
irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery,
which may actually increase the risk of suicide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2022 Regular Session</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To: Public Health and Welfare</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By: Senator(s) Younger</p>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Senate Bill 2728</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>AN ACT TO ENACT THE MISSISSIPPI SAVE ADOLESCENTS FROM EXPERIMENTATION
(SAFE) ACT; TO PROVIDE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS RELATED TO THE SAFE ACT; TO
DEFINE CERTAIN TERMS USED IN THE ACT; TO PROVIDE THAT A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH
CARE PROFESSIONAL SHALL NOT PROVIDE GENDER TRANSITION PROCEDURES TO ANY INDIVIDUAL
UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE; TO PROVIDE THAT A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL
SHALL NOT REFER ANY INDIVIDUAL UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE TO ANY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL
FOR GENDER TRANSITION PROCEDURES; TO ALLOW FOR CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE PROHIBITION
THAT PHYSICIANS CANNOT PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES; TO PROVIDE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS SHALL
NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO ANY ENTITY OR INDIVIDUAL THAT PROVIDES GENDER TRANSITION PROCEDURES
TO AN INDIVIDUAL UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE; TO PROVIDE FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT; TO
PROHIBIT A HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN UNDER AN INSURANCE PLAN FROM PROVIDING INSURANCE
COVERAGE OF GENDER TRANSITION PROCEDURES FOR MINORS; AND FOR RELATED PURPOSES.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BE IT ENACTED BY THE
LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>SECTION 1.</u></b>&nbsp; This
act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;Mississippi Save Adolescents from
Experimentation (SAFE) Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>SECTION 2.</u></b> &nbsp;<b>Legislative
findings.</b> &nbsp;The Mississippi Legislature finds the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;Mississippi has a
compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its
citizens, especially vulnerable children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;Only a small
percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying with
their biological sex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;According to
the American Psychiatric Association, &quot;For natal adult males, prevalence
ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females, from 0.002% to 0.003%.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) &nbsp;For the small
percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress and emotional
conflict when identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently
demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in
adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions
unnecessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) &nbsp;Furthermore,
scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress and emotional
conflict when identifying with their biological sex often have already
experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged
to seek mental health services to address comorbidities and underlying causes
of their distress before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) &nbsp;Suicide rates,
psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the
background population even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment
procedures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;(i) &nbsp;Some health care
providers are prescribing puberty blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing
hormone analogues, in order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in
children who experience distress and emotional conflict when identifying with
their biological sex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) &nbsp;The
prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of any
long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these
drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g) &nbsp;Health care
providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience
distress and emotional conflict when identifying with their biological sex, despite
the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy
or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the
purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) &nbsp;The use of cross-sex
hormones comes with serious known risks, such as:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) &nbsp;For
biological females:</p>

liver dysfunction;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. &nbsp;Increased
risk of breast and uterine cancers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>and</p>

infertility.</p>

disease, including blood clots;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Cholelithiasis,
including gallstones;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Coronary

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Macroprolactinoma,
which is a tumor of the pituitary gland;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. &nbsp;Cerebrovascular
disease, including strokes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. &nbsp;Hypertriglyceridemia,
which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;Breast

infertility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) &nbsp;Genital and
nongenital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for

<p class=P06-00>Sec.&nbsp;2. <span class=SECHEAD>Legislative
findings </span></p>

<p class=P06-00>The legislature finds that: </p>

<p class=P06-00>1. Arizona has a compelling governmental interest in
protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable
children.</p>

<p class=P06-00>2. Only a small percentage of the American
population experiences distress at identifying with their biological
sex. According to the American Psychiatric Association, &quot;For
natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal
females, from 0.002% to 0.003%.&quot;. </p>

<p class=P06-00>3. For the small percentage of children who are
gender-nonconforming or who experience distress at identifying with their
biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to
identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby
rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.</p>

<p class=P06-00>4. Furthermore, scientific studies show that
individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex
often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these
individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health services to address
comorbidities and underlying causes of their distress before undertaking any
hormonal or surgical intervention.</p>

<p class=P06-00>5. Even among people who have undergone inpatient
gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities and
mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.</p>

<p class=P06-00>6. Some healthcare providers are prescribing
puberty-blocking drugs, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in
order to delay the onset or progression of puberty in children who experience
distress at identifying with their biological sex. The prescribing
of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of any long-term
longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for
the treatment of such distress or gender transition. </p>

<p class=P06-00>7. Health care providers are also prescribing
cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with
their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have
been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in
adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender
transition.</p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>8. The use of
cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks, such as: </p>

<p class=P06-00 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(a) For biological
females:</p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood
cells. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Severe liver dysfunction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Coronary artery disease, including heart
attacks.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Hypertension.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Increased risk of breast and uterine cancers. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(vii) Irreversible infertility. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) For biological males.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Coronary artery disease, including heart
attacks.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the
pituitary gland.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated
level of tryglycerides in the blood.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vii) Breast cancer. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(viii) Irreversible infertility. </p>

<p class=P06-00>9. Genital and nongenital gender reassignment
surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence
indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more
frequent.</p>

<p class=P06-00>10. Genital gender reassignment surgery includes
several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the
alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts, including: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) For biological males: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Genital reconstruction including penectomy,
which is the removal of the penis.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the
testicles.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a
vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Clitoroplasty, which is the construction of a
clitoris-like structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like
structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) For biological females: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) A hysterectomy or oophorectomy. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Reconstruction of the urethra.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Genital reconstruction including
metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like structure.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the
vagina. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a
penis-like and scrotum-like structure. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Implantation of erection or testicular
prostheses.</p>

<p class=P06-00>11. The complications, risks and long-term care
concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and
females are numerous and complex.</p>

<p class=P06-00>12. Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes
various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the
alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts,
including: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(a) For biological males: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) Augmentation mammoplasty. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Facial feminization surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Liposuction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Lipofilling. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Voice surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Thyroid cartilage reduction.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(vii) Gluteal augmentation.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(viii) Hair reconstruction. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ix) Other aesthetic procedures. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(b) For biological females: </p>

<p class=P06-00>(i) A subcutaneous mastectomy. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(ii) Voice surgery.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(iii) Liposuction. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(iv) Lipofilling.</p>

<p class=P06-00>(v) Pectoral implants. </p>

<p class=P06-00>(vi) Other aesthetic procedures.</p>

<p class=P06-00>13. It is an accepted principle of economics and
public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed,
demand for that service or product is increased. Between 2015 and
2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by nearly twenty percent in the
United States.</p>

<p class=P06-00>14. It is of grave concern to the legislature that
the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at
identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and
drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently
sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies
showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks. </p>

<p class=P06-00>15. The risks of gender transition procedures far
outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures. <span style='display:none'>END_STATUTE</span></p>

HOUSE BILL NO. 570

BY REPRESENTATIVE FIRMENT

HEALTH/CHILDREN:  Prohibits certain procedures to alter the sex of a minor child

1 AN ACT

2 To enact Part VIII of Chapter 5-A of Title 40 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, to

3 be comprised of R.S. 40:1091.1 through 1091.8, relative to gender reassignment

4 procedures; to provide for a short title; to provide for the prohibition of certain

5 procedures to alter a minor child's sex and to designate this act as the Save

6 Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act; and to provide for related matters.

7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of Louisiana:

8 Section 1.  Part VIII of Chapter 5-A of Title 40 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of

9 1950, comprised of R.S. 40:1091.1 through 1091.8, is hereby enacted to read as follows: 

10 PART VIII.  THE SAVE ADOLESCENTS FROM EXPERIMENTATION ACT

11 §1091.1.  Short title; purpose 

12 A.  This Part shall be known and cited as the ""SAFE Act"".

13 B.  This state has a compelling governmental interest in protecting the health

14 and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children.

15 C.  Only a tiny percent of the American population experiences distress at

16 identifying with their biological sex.  According to the American Psychiatric

17 Association, prevalence ranges from five thousandths of a percent to fourteen

18 thousandths of a percent for natal adult males and from two thousandths of a percent

19 to four thousandths of a percent for natal females.

1 D.  Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who

2 are gender non-conforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological

3 sex come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby

4 rendering most medical healthcare interventions unnecessary.

5 E.  Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at

6 identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced

7 psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek

8 mental healthcare services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention.

9 F.  Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly

10 elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment

11 procedures have been performed.

12 G.  Some healthcare providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in

13 order to delay the onset or progression of normally-timed puberty in children who

14 experience distress at identifying with their biological sex.  This is being done

15 despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and

16 benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.

17 H.  Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children

18 who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that

19 no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use

20 of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress

21 or gender transition.

22 I.  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known

23 risks:

24 (1)  For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary

25 artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and

26 uterine cancers, and irreversible infertility.

27 (2)  For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis,

28 macroprolactinoma, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,

29 hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, and irreversible infertility.

HB NO. 570

1 J.  Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not

2 recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have

3 such surgeries are becoming more frequent.

4 K.  Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive

5 procedures for males and females and involves the following alterations of

6 biologically normal and functional body parts:

7 (1)  For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction

8 including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.

9 (2)  For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or

10 oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including

11 metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of

12 erection or testicular prostheses.

13 L.  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with

14 genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and

15 complex.

16 M.  Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive

17 procedures for males and females, including the following procedures, and also

18 involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts:

19 (1)  For biological males, procedures may include augmentation

20 mommoplasty, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling voice surgery,

21 thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other

22 aesthetic procedures. 

23 (2)  For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous

24 mastectomy, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair

25 reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures.

26 N.  It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a

27 service or product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product

28 increases.  Between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by

29 twenty percent.

HB NO. 570

1 O.  It is a grave concern to the Legislature of Louisiana that the medical

2 community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their

3 biological sex to be subjects of irreversible, and drastic non-genital gender

4 reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender

5 reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such

6 extreme interventions outweigh the risks.

7 P.  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this

8 stage of clinical study on these procedures.

Senate Bill 141

By: Senators Dixon of the 45th, Gooch of the 51st, Harbin of the 16th, Robertson of the 29th,

Still of the 48th and others 

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

AN ACT

To amend Chapter 1 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to1

general provisions relative to professions and businesses, so as to prohibit health care2

providers from performing specified practices on minors relating to altering a person's3

appearance relating to gender; to prohibit health care providers from aiding or abetting such4

practices for minors; to provide for definitions; to provide for exceptions; to provide for5

enforcement; to amend Part 3 of Article 16 of Chapter 2 of Title 20 of the Official Code of6

Georgia Annotated, relating to student health, so as to prohibit school nurses and other7

employees and officials from engaging in certain conduct relating to a minor's perception of8

his or her gender; to provide for legislative findings; to provide for related matters; to provide9

for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.10

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:11

SECTION 1.12

The General Assembly finds and declares that:13

(1)  This state has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of14

its citizens, especially vulnerable children;15



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 2 -

(2)  Only a tiny percentage of the American population experiences distress at identifying16

with their biological sex.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence17

ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent18

for natal females;19

(3)  Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender20

nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to21

identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most22

medical health care interventions unnecessary;23

(4)  Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their24

biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these25

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services before undertaking26

any hormonal or surgical intervention;27

(5)  Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated28

above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been29

performed;30

(6)  Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay31

the onset or progression of normally timed puberty in children who experience distress at32

identifying with their biological sex.  This is being done despite the lack of any long-term33

longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment34

of such distress or gender transition;35

(7)  Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who36

experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no37

randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of38

cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender39

transition;40

(8)  The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks:41



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 3 -

(A)  For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery42

disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine43

cancers, and irreversible infertility; and44

(B)  For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery45

disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer,46

and irreversible infertility;47

(9)  Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for48

children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are49

becoming more frequent;50

(10)  Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures51

for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and52

functional body parts:53

(A)  For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including54

penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty; and55

(B)  For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy,56

reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or57

phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular58

prostheses;59

(11)  The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender60

reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;61

(12)  Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for62

males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and63

functional body parts:64

(A)  For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial65

feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction,66

gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures; and67



23 LC 33 9320

S. B. 141
- 4 -

(B)  For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice68

surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures;69

(13)  It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or70

product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases.  Just71

between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent;72

(14)  It is of grave concern that the medical community is allowing individuals who73

experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and74

drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing75

genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits76

of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks; and77

(15)  The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of78

clinical study on these procedures.79

SECTION 2.80

Chapter 1 of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to general81

provisions relative to professions and businesses, is amending by adding a new Code section82

(e)(1)  The provision of services to or engaging in conduct regarding any minor described135

in subsections (b) and (c) of this Code section shall be considered unprofessional conduct136

and shall be subject to discipline by the licensing entity with jurisdiction over the health137

care provider.138

(2)  A person may assert an actual or threatened violation of this Code section as a claim139

or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding and obtain compensatory damages,140

According to the American psychiatric association, prevalence ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 percent for natal adult males and from 0.002 to 0.003 percent for natal females;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(3) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast majority of children who are gender non-conforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical health care interventions unnecessary;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(4) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(5) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been performed;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(6) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs in order to delay the onset or progression of normally-timed puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex. This is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(7) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following serious known risks:</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(A) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers, and irreversible infertility.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(B) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, and irreversible infertility.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(9) Genital and non-genital reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the following alterations of biologically normal and functional body parts:</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(A) For biological males, surgery may involve genital reconstruction including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty, clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(B) For biological females, surgery may involve a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or testicular prostheses.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(11) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(12) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and functional body parts:</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(A) For biological males, procedures may include augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other aesthetic procedures.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(B) For biological females, procedures may include subcutaneous mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures.</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(13) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or paid for, demand for that service or product increases. Just between 2015 and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by 20 percent;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(14) It is of grave concern to the Legislature that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks;</span></p><p class=""cs2EA4A6EB""><span class=""cs522F6215"">(15) The risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.</span></p><h4 class=""cs93B7D06"">

to the American psychiatric association</span> prevalence ranges from to percent for natal adult males and from to percent for natal females <span class=""copied-language"">Studies consistently demonstrate that the</span> vast majority <span class=""copied-language"">of children who are gender</span> non-conforming <span class=""copied-language"">or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood thereby rendering most</span> medical health care interventions unnecessary <span class=""copied-language"">Scientific studies show that individuals struggling with distress at identifying with their biological sex often have already experienced psychopathology which indicates these individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health</span> care services <span class=""copied-language"">before undertaking any hormonal or surgical intervention Suicide rates psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population</span> after inpatient gender reassignment procedures have been performed Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs <span class=""copied-language"">in order to delay the onset or progression of</span> normally-timed <span class=""copied-language"">puberty in children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex</span> This <span class=""copied-language"">is being done despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition</span> Health care <span class=""copied-language"">providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in

reconstruction including penectomy</span> orchiectomy vaginoplasty clitoroplasty and vulvoplasty <span class=""copied-language"">For biological females surgery may involve a hysterectomy or

vulnerable children.

(B) Only a tiny percentage of the American population 

experiences distress at identifying with their biological sex. 

According to the American Psychiatric Association, prevalence 

ranges from 0.005 to 0.014 per cent for natal adult males and 

from 0.002 to 0.003 per cent for natal females.

(C) Studies consistently demonstrate that the vast 

majority of children who are gender nonconforming or experience 

distress at identifying with their biological sex come to 

identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, 

thereby rendering most medical health care interventions 

unnecessary.

(D) Scientific studies show that individuals struggling 

with distress at identifying with their biological sex often 

have already experienced psychopathology, which indicates these 

individuals should be encouraged to seek mental health care 

services before undertaking any hormonal or surgical 

intervention.

(E) Suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality 

rates remain markedly elevated above the background population 

after inpatient gender reassignment surgery has been performed.

(F) Some health care providers are prescribing puberty-

blocking drugs in order to delay the onset or progression of 

normally timed puberty in children who experience distress at 

identifying with their biological sex. This is being done

despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies 

evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the 

treatment of such distress or gender transition.

(G) Health care providers are also prescribing cross-sex 

hormones for children who experience distress at identifying 

with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized 

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of 

the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the 

purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.

(H) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with the following 

serious known risks:

(1) For biological females, erythrocytosis, severe liver 

dysfunction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, 

hypertension, increased risk of breast and uterine cancers, and 

irreversible infertility;

(2) For biological males, thromboembolic disease, 

cholelithiasis, coronary artery disease, macroprolactinoma, 

cerebrovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, breast cancer, 

and irreversible infertility.

(I) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries 

are generally not recommended for children, although evidence 

indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are 

becoming more frequent.

(J) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several 

irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and 

involves the following alterations of biologically normal and 

functional body parts:

(1) For biological males, surgery may involve genital 

reconstruction including penectomy, orchiectomy, vaginoplasty,

clitoroplasty, and vulvoplasty.

(2) For biological females, surgery may involve a 

hysterectomy or oophorectomy, reconstruction of the urethra, 

genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, 

vaginectomy, scrotoplasty, and implantation of erection or 

testicular prostheses.

(K) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns 

associated with genital gender reassignment surgery for both 

males and females are numerous and complex.

(L) Non-genital gender reassignment surgery includes 

various invasive procedures for males and females and also 

involves the alteration or removal of biologically normal and 

functional body parts:

(1) For biological males, procedures may include 

augmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, 

liposuction, lipofilling, voice surgery, thyroid cartilage 

reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction, and other 

aesthetic procedures.

(2) For biological females, procedures may include 

subcutaneous mastectomy, voice surgery, liposuction, 

lipofilling, pectoral implants, and other aesthetic procedures.

(M) It is an accepted principle of economics and public 

policy that when a service or product is subsidized or paid for, 

demand for that service or product increases. Just between 2015 

and 2016, gender reassignment surgeries increased by twenty per 

cent.

(N) It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that 

the medical community is allowing individuals who experience 

distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects

surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender 

reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing that 

the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the risks.

any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these services.

HOUSE BILL NO. 463

BY REPRESENTATIVE FIRMENT

Prefiled pursuant to Article III, Section 2(A)(4)(b)(i) of the Constitution of Louisiana.

HEALTH/CHILDREN:  Prohibits certain procedures to alter the sex of a minor child

1 AN ACT

2 To enact Part IX of Chapter 5-A of Title 40 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, to be

3 comprised of R.S. 40:1098.1 through 1098.7, relative to gender reassignment

4 procedures; to provide for definitions; to exclude certain services, treatments, and

5 procedures relative to gender reassignment; to provide certain restrictions for

6 healthcare personnel; to provide for funding restrictions; to provide for health

7 insurance policy restrictions; to establish disciplinary procedures; to provide for

8 judicial relief; and to provide for related matters.

9 Be it enacted by the Legislature of Louisiana:

10 Section 1.  Part IX of Chapter 5-A of Title 40 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of

11 1950, comprised of R.S. 40:1098.1 through 1098.7, is hereby enacted to read as follows: 

12 PART IX.  THE SAVE ADOLESCENTS FROM EXPERIMENTATION ACT

13 §1098.1.  Legislative findings 

14 A.  This state has a compelling governmental interest in protecting the health

15 and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children.

16 B.  The legislature determines that medical procedures that alter a minor's

17 hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, or otherwise change a minor's

18 physical appearance are harmful to a minor when these medical procedures are

19 performed for the purpose of enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a

20 purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sexual orientation or treating

HLS 23RS-362 ORIGINAL
HB NO. 463

1 purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and

2 asserted identity.  These procedures can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly

3 sterile, having increased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse and

4 sometimes fatal psychological consequences.  Moreover, the legislature finds it

5 likely that all of the harmful effects associated with these types of medical

6 procedures when performed on a minor are not yet fully known when performed on

7 a minor and, for such purposes, are experimental in nature and unsupported by

8 high-quality, long-term medical studies.

9 C.  The legislature determines that there is evidence that medical procedures

10 that alter a minor's hormonal balance, remove a minor's sex organs, or otherwise

11 change a minor's physical appearance are not consistent with professional medical

12 standards when the medical procedures are performed for the purpose of enabling a

13 minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's

14 sex or treating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the

15 minor's sex and asserted identity because a minor's discordance can be resolved by

16 less invasive approaches that are likely to result in better outcomes for the minor.

17 D.  The legislature finds that medical procedures are being performed on and

18 administered to minors in this state for such purposes, notwithstanding the risks and

19 harms to the minors.

20 E. The legislature finds that minors lack the maturity to fully understand and

21 appreciate the life-altering consequences of such procedures and that many

22 individuals have expressed regret for medical procedures that were performed on or

23 administered to them for such purposes when they were minors.

24 F.  It is a grave concern to the legislature that the medical community is

25 allowing individuals who experience distress identifying with their biological sex to

26 be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and

27 irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the

28 lack of studies showing that the benefits of such extreme interventions outweigh the

29 risks.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED 1 

AN ACT TO ESTABLISH GOVERNING PROVISIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF 2 

GENDER DYSPHORIA FOR PERSONS UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. 3 

Whereas, gender dysphoria is an extremely complex and challenging mental health 4 

disorder; and 5 

Whereas, patients seeking gender transition procedure often suffer from significant 6 

mental and social stressors; and 7 

Whereas, it is in the State's interest to protect minor patients from permanent harm; 8 

Now, therefore, 9 

The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts: 10 

SECTION 1.  Chapter 90 of the General Statutes is amended by adding a new Article 11 

to read: 12 

""Article 1M. 13 

""Minor Protection Act. 14

of reproductive potential or capacity, such as sex chromosomes, naturally 18 

occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external 19 

genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, 20 

chosen, or subjective experience of gender. 21 

(2) Cross-sex hormones. – Testosterone or other androgens given to biological 22 

females in amounts that are larger or more potent than would normally occur 23

naturally in healthy biological sex males. 26 

(3) Department. – The Department of Health and Human Services. 27 

(4) Gender. – The psychological, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of being 28 

male or female. 29 

(5) Gender reassignment surgery. – Any medical or surgical service that seeks to 30 

surgically alter or remove healthy physical or anatomical characteristics or 31 

features that are typical for the individual's biological sex, in order to instill or 32 

create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different 33 

from the individual's biological sex, including a genital or non-genital gender 34 

reassignment surgery as defined in this section. 35

""§ 90-21.141.  Limitations of certain practices and health care services. 27 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall be unlawful for any physician or 28 

other health care provider to provide gender transition procedures to any individual under 18 29 

years of age, except as provided in this section. A physician or other health care provider shall 30 

not refer any individual under 18 years of age to any health care provider for gender transition 31 

procedures. Any counseling or treatment rendered under this Article shall not be via telehealth 32 

and must be rendered through face-to-face encounters. 33 

(b) It shall not be unlawful for a physician to perform a gender transition procedure to an 34 

individual under 18 years of age, if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 35 

(1) Prior to the gender transition procedure, at least two physicians, including a 36 

pediatric psychiatrist who has performed a standard psychiatric clinical 37 

evaluation inclusive of differential diagnosis must certify and document in 38 

writing that the patient suffers from a condition that would benefit from a 39 

gender transition procedure. The certifying pediatric psychiatrist shall not be 40 

employed by the same practice or institution as the certifying physician. 41 

(2) Both parents must sign the standardized consent form provided by the 42 

physician performing the gender transition procedure. 43 

(3) The patient under 18 years of age must sign the standardized consent form 44

(4) For the duration of six months preceding the gender transition procedure, the 46 

patient must receive regular care consisting of at least monthly appointments 47 

from a pediatric psychiatrist. 48 

(5) The physician and the pediatric psychiatrist must separately document in 49 

writing the need for ongoing therapy every six months. 50 



General Assembly Of North Carolina Session 2023 

Page 4  DRS55047-NB-40A 

(6) The patient must receive ongoing care from a pediatric psychiatrist until the 1 

patient attains the age of majority. 2 

(c) A physician or other health care provider shall not be prohibited from providing any 3 

of the following procedures to a minor: 4 

(1) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex 5 

development, including a person with external biological sex characteristics 6 

that are unresolvedly ambiguous, such as those born with 46 XX 7 

chromosomes with virilization, 46 XY chromosomes with under-virilization, 8 

or having both ovarian and testicular tissue. 9 

(2) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of 10 

sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or 11 

biochemical testing that the person does not have normal sex chromosome 12 

structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action. 13 

(3) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been 14 

caused by or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition procedures, 15 

whether or not the gender transition procedure was performed in accordance 16 

with State and federal law or whether or not funding for the gender transition 17 

procedure is permissible under this Article. 18 

(4) Any procedure undertaken because the individual suffers from a physical 19 

disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a 20 

physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of 21 

major bodily function unless surgery is performed. 22 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Article, a physician or health care provider may 23 

provide health care services, treatments, or procedures that directly treat a physical disorder, 24 

injury, or illness that does not put the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of 25 

major bodily function, if the physical disorder, injury, or illness is for the purposes of gender 26 

transition. 27 

(e) A State, county, or local health care facility, physician, or health care provider shall 28 

not perform gender transition procedures for a minor, except as provided in this Article. 29 

(f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a physician or health care provider 30 

to perform a gender transition procedure. 31 

""§ 90-21.142.  Limitation on use of State funds for gender transition procedures. 32 

Public funds shall not be directly or indirectly used, granted, paid, or distributed to any entity, 33 

organization, or individual that provides gender transition procedures to a minor. 34 

""§ 90-21.143.  Standardized consent form. 35 

(a) The Department shall develop and maintain a standardized consent form for parents 36 

to sign prior to a gender transition procedure under this Article. The Department shall also 37 

develop and maintain a standardized consent form for a patient under 18 years of age to sign 38 

prior to a gender transition procedure. 39 

(b) The minor and the minor's parents must sign the consent form at least 30 days before 40 

the first treatment of the gender transition procedure and at every subsequent medical visit for 41 

treatment. 42 

(c) The consent form must comply with all of the following: 43 

(1) Printed in justified typeface and be printed in at least 14-point sized font. 44 

(2) Contain the following statement: 45 

""If your child begins one (1) of these treatments, it may actually worsen the 46 

discordance and thus increase the likelihood that your child will need 47 

additional and more serious interventions to address the worsening condition. 48 

For example, if your child begins socially transitioning or taking puberty 49 

blockers, that treatment may significantly increase the likelihood that your 50 

child's discordance will worsen and lead to your child eventually seeking 51 



General Assembly Of North Carolina Session 2023 

DRS55047-NB-40A  Page 5 

cross-sex hormones or even surgery to remove some of your child's body 1 

parts. Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom have conducted systematic 2 

reviews of evidence and conclude that there is no evidence that the potential 3 

benefits of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for this purpose 4 

outweigh the known or assumed risks. 5 

Medical authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the United Kingdom 6 

have since recommended psychotherapy as the first line of treatment for youth 7 

gender dysphoria with drugs and surgeries reserved as a measure of last resort. 8 

Medical authorities in France have advised great caution when prescribing 9 

hormones for gender dysphoria. 10 

There are people who underwent gender transition treatments as minors and 11 

later regretted that decision and the physical harm that these treatments 12 

caused, and the total percentage of people who experience this regret is 13 

unknown. Some estimate that the rate is below two percent (2%), but that 14 

estimate is based on studies done on adults who transitioned as adults or on 15 

minors who transitioned under highly restrictive and controlled conditions. 16 

Sometimes gender transition treatments have been proposed as a way to 17 

reduce the chances of a minor committing suicide due to discordance between 18 

the minor's sex and his or her perception, but the rates of actual suicide from 19 

this discordance remain extremely low. Furthermore, as recognized by health 20 

authorities in Europe, there is no evidence that suicidality is caused by 21 

unaffirmed gender or that gender transition treatments are causally linked to a 22 

reduction in serious suicidal attempts or ideations."" 23 

(3) If the treatment involves puberty blockers, the consent form shall contain the 24 

following additional statement: 25 

""Puberty blockers are not approved for this purpose by the United States Food 26 

and Drug Administration, which is the federal agency that determines which 27 

drugs are safe and effective for humans to use. Claims about puberty blockers' 28 

safety and efficacy are based on their use for precocious puberty, a different 29 

condition in which normal puberty is allowed to resume once the patient 30 

reaches the appropriate age. Studies on the benefits of using puberty blockers 31 

for gender dysphoria are notoriously weak. Puberty blockers are not fully 32 

reversible because, among other risks, puberty blockers may intensify a 33 

minor's discordance and cause it to persist. Puberty blockers increase the risk 34 

of your child being sterilized, meaning that he or she will never be able to 35 

have children. Puberty blockers may also cause diminished bone density for 36 

your child, increasing the risk of fracture and early osteoporosis. Puberty 37 

blockers may also prevent your child from ever being able to engage in sexual 38 

activity or achieve orgasm for the rest of your child's life. There is no research 39 

on the long-term risks to minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers. 40 

The full effects of puberty blockers on brain development and cognition are 41 

unknown."" 42 

(4) If the treatment involves cross-sex hormones, the consent form shall contain 43 

the following additional statement: 44 

""The use of cross-sex hormones in males is associated with numerous health 45 

risks, such as thromboembolic disease, including, without limitation, blood 46 

clots; cholelithiasis, including gallstones; coronary artery disease, including, 47 

without limitation, heart attacks; macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the 48 

pituitary gland; cerebrovascular disease, including, without limitation, 49 

strokes; hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the 50 

blood; breast cancer; and irreversible infertility. The use of cross-sex 51 



General Assembly Of North Carolina Session 2023 

Page 6  DRS55047-NB-40A 

hormones in females is associated with risks of erythrocytosis, which is an 1 

increase in red blood cells; severe liver dysfunction; coronary artery disease, 2 

including, without limitation, heart attacks; hypertension; and increased risk 3 

of breast and uterine cancers. Once a minor begins cross-sex hormones, the 4 

minor may need to continue taking those hormones for many years and 5 

possibly for the remainder of the minor's life. The cost of these hormones may 6 

be tens of thousands of dollars. If the use of cross-sex hormones leads to 7 

surgery, the total cost of transitioning may exceed one hundred thousand 8 

dollars ($100,000)."" 9 

(5) If the treatment involves a surgical procedure, the consent form shall contain 10 

the following additional statement: 11 

""The dangers, risks, complications, and long-term concerns associated with 12 

these types of procedures are almost entirely unknown. There are no long-term 13 

studies on either the effectiveness or safety of these surgical procedures."" 14 

""§ 90-21.144.  Civil remedies. 15 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a physician or health care 16 

provider who performs a gender transition procedure is liable to the minor if the minor is injured, 17 

including, without limitation, any physical, psychological, emotional, or physiological injury, by 18 

the gender transition procedure, related treatment, or the effects of the gender transition 19 

procedure or related treatment. 20 

(b) A minor injured as provided under subsection (a) of this section, or a representative 21 

of the minor, may bring a civil action against the physician or health care provider who performed 22 

the gender transition procedure on the minor in a court of competent jurisdiction and seek all of 23 

the following: 24 

(1) Declaratory relief or injunctive relief. 25 

(2) Compensatory damages. 26 

(3) Punitive damages. 27 

(4) Attorneys' fees and costs. 28 

(c) A claim of action arising from this section must be filed within 15 years after the date 29 

on which the minor attains the age of majority or the date the minor would have attained the age 30 

of majority if the minor predeceases prior to that date. 31 

(d) It shall be a defense to a claim filed in accordance with this section, if the physician 32 

or health care provider (i) documented the minor's perceived gender during the entirety of the 33 

course of treatment and the minor's perceived gender was different from the minor's biological 34 

sex, (ii) the physician and pediatric psychiatrist certified in writing that the gender transition 35 

procedure was the only way to treat the minor's condition, (iii) that the minor suffered from no 36 

other mental health concerns or conditions, including depression, eating disorders, autism, 37 

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, or psychotic disorders, and (iv) the 38 

physician received the consent form from the minor and the minor's parents in accordance with 39 

this Article. 40 

""§ 90-21.145.  Violation; enforcement. 41 

(a) A violation of this Article by a physician or other health care provider shall be 42 

considered unprofessional conduct and shall be subject to revocation of licensure and other 43 

appropriate discipline by the North Carolina Medical Board, North Carolina Board of Nursing, 44 

or other appropriate licensing board, as applicable. 45 

(b) A person may assert an actual or threatened violation of this Article as a claim or 46 

defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding and obtain compensatory damages, injunctive 47 

relief, declaratory relief, or any other appropriate relief. 48 

(c) A certification for a gender transition procedure by a physician under this Article is 49 

not an affirmative defense to a claim brought under this Chapter or other applicable State or 50 

federal law for medical malpractice or other civil claims of action. 51

visit for treatment The consent form must comply with all of the following Printed in justified typeface and be printed in at least -point sized font Contain the following statement If your child begins one of these treatments it may actually worsen the discordance and thus increase the likelihood that your child will need additional and more serious interventions to address the worsening condition For example if your child begins socially transitioning or taking puberty blockers that treatment may significantly increase the likelihood that your child s discordance will worsen and lead to your child eventually seeking General Assembly Of North Carolina Session DRS557-NB-A Page cross-sex hormones or even surgery to remove some of your child s body parts Sweden Finland and the United Kingdom have conducted systematic reviews of evidence and conclude that there is no evidence that the potential benefits of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for this purpose outweigh the known or assumed risks Medical authorities in Sweden Finland Norway and the United Kingdom have since recommended psychotherapy as the first line of treatment for youth gender dysphoria with drugs and surgeries reserved as a measure of last resort Medical authorities in France have advised great caution when prescribing hormones for gender dysphoria There are people who underwent gender transition treatments as minors and later regretted that decision and the physical harm that these treatments caused and the total percentage of people who experience this regret is unknown Some estimate that the rate is below two percent but that estimate is based on studies done on adults who transitioned as adults or on minors who transitioned under highly restrictive and controlled conditions Sometimes gender transition treatments have been proposed as a way to reduce the chances of a minor committing suicide due to discordance between the minor s sex and his or her perception but the rates of actual suicide from this discordance remain extremely low Furthermore as recognized by health authorities in Europe there is no evidence that suicidality is caused by unaffirmed gender or that gender transition treatments are causally linked to a reduction in serious suicidal attempts or ideations If the treatment involves puberty blockers the consent form shall contain the following additional statement Puberty blockers are not approved for this purpose by the United States Food and Drug Administration which is the federal agency that determines which drugs are safe and effective for humans to use Claims about puberty blockers safety and efficacy are based on their use for precocious puberty a different condition in which normal puberty is allowed to resume once the patient reaches the appropriate age Studies on the benefits of using puberty blockers for gender dysphoria are notoriously weak Puberty blockers are not fully reversible because among other risks puberty blockers may intensify a minor s discordance and cause it to persist Puberty blockers increase the risk of your child being sterilized meaning that he or she will never be able to have children Puberty blockers may also cause diminished bone density for your child increasing the risk of fracture and early osteoporosis Puberty blockers may also prevent your child from ever being able to engage in sexual activity or achieve orgasm for the rest of your child s life There is no research on the long-term risks to minors of persistent exposure to puberty blockers The full effects of puberty blockers on brain development and cognition are unknown If the treatment involves cross-sex hormones the consent form shall contain the following additional statement <span class=""copied-language"">The use of cross-sex hormones in</span> males is associated with numerous health risks such as thromboembolic disease including without limitation <span class=""copied-language"">blood clots cholelithiasis including gallstones coronary artery disease including</span> without limitation <span class=""copied-language"">heart attacks macroprolactinoma which is a tumor of the pituitary gland cerebrovascular disease including</span> without limitation <span class=""copied-language"">strokes hypertriglyceridemia which is an elevated level of</span> triglycerides <span class=""copied-language"">in the blood breast cancer and irreversible infertility</span> The use of cross-sex General Assembly Of North Carolina Session Page DRS7-NB-A hormones in females is associated with risks of <span class=""copied-language"">erythrocytosis which is an increase in red blood cells severe liver dysfunction coronary artery disease including</span> without limitation heart attacks hypertension and <span class=""copied-language"">increased risk of breast and uterine cancers</span> Once a minor begins cross-sex hormones the minor may need to continue taking those hormones for many years and possibly for the remainder of the minor s life The cost of these hormones may be tens of thousands of dollars If <span class=""copied-language"">the use of cross-sex hormones</span> leads to surgery the total cost of transitioning may exceed one hundred thousand dollars If the treatment involves a surgical procedure the consent form shall contain the following additional statement The dangers risks complications and long-term concerns associated with these types of procedures are almost entirely unknown There are no long-term studies on either the effectiveness or safety of these surgical procedures § - Civil remedies <span class=""copied-language"">Notwithstanding any other provision of law</span> to the contrary a physician or health care provider who performs a gender transition procedure is liable to the minor if the minor is injured including without limitation any physical psychological emotional or physiological injury by the gender transition procedure related treatment or the effects of the gender transition procedure or related treatment A minor injured as provided under subsection of this section or a representative of the minor may bring a civil action against the physician or health care provider who performed the gender transition procedure on the minor in a court of competent jurisdiction and seek all of the following Declaratory relief or injunctive relief Compensatory damages Punitive damages Attorneys fees and costs A claim of action arising from this section must be filed within years after the date on which the minor attains the age of majority or the date the minor would have attained the age of majority if the minor predeceases prior to that date It shall be a defense to a claim filed in accordance with this section if the

RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- RHODE ISLAND'S CHILDREN DESERVE 

HELP NOT HARM ACT -- MINOR'S GENDER TRANSITION 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: May 01, 2023 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose. 1 

The general assembly finds that: 2 

(1) Rhode Island has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of 3 

its citizens, especially vulnerable children;  4 

(2) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying 5 

with their biological sex;  6 

(3) For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience 7 

distress identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority 8 

come to embrace their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical 9 

physiological interventions unnecessary; 10 

(4) Scientific studies show that individuals experiencing distress identifying with their 11 

biological sex have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria, 12 

which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services; 13 

(5) Even among individuals who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment 14 

procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated 15 

above the background population; 16 

(6) Some healthcare professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs such as 17 

gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the natural onset or progression of 18 



 

 

 

LC001556 - Page 2 of 11 

puberty in children, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex: 1 

(i) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed, despite the lack of any long-term 2 

longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such 3 

distress or gender dysphoria; and 4 

(ii) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner 5 

on children; 6 

(7) Some healthcare professionals are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children 7 

who are experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact no randomized 8 

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in 9 

adults or children for the purpose of gender transition; 10 

(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks: 11 

(i) For biological females, some risks may include; 12 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 13 

(B) Severe liver dysfunction; 14 

(C) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 15 

(D) Increased risk of breast, cervical, and uterine cancers; 16 

(E) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; 17 

(F) Hypertension; 18 

(G) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; 19 

(H) Sleep apnea; 20 

(I) Type 2 diabetes; 21 

(J) Loss of bone density; 22 

(K) Destabilization of psychiatric disorders; and 23 

(ii) For biological males, some risks may include: 24 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 25 

(B) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; 26 

(C) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; 27 

(D) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 28 

(E) Type 2 diabetes; 29 

(F) Breast cancer; 30 

(G) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland; 31 

(H) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; and 32 

(I) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood; 33 

(9) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended 34 



 

 

 

LC001556 - Page 3 of 11 

for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming 1 

more frequent; 2 

(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures 3 

for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. 4 

These procedures are generally irreversible; 5 

(i) For biological males, surgery may involve: 6 

(A) Genital reconstruction, including a penectomy, which is the removal of the penis; 7 

(B) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles; 8 

(C) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a 9 

penile inversion procedure; 10 

(D) Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and 11 

(E) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure; 12 

(ii) For biological females, surgery may involve: 13 

(A) Hysterectomy or oophorectomy; 14 

(B) Reconstruction of the urethra; 15 

(C) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the 16 

construction of a penis-like structure; 17 

(D) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina; 18 

(E) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure; and 19 

(F) Implantation of erection and/or testicular prosthesis; 20 

(iii) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital sex 21 

reassignment surgery, for both males and females, are numerous and complex; 22 

(iv) Non-genital sex reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males 23 

and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically health, and functional body 24 

parts: 25 

(A) For biological males, this surgery may involve: 26 

(I) Augmentation mammoplasty; 27 

(II) Facial feminization surgery; 28 

(III) Liposuction; 29 

(IV) Lipofilling; 30 

(V) Voice feminization surgery; 31 

(VI) Thyroid cartilage reduction; 32 

(VII) Gluteal augmentation; 33 

(VIII) Hair reconstruction; and 34 



 

 

 

LC001556 - Page 4 of 11 

(IX) Other aesthetic procedures; 1 

(B) For biological females, this surgery may involve: 2 

(I) Subcutaneous mastectomy; 3 

(II) Voice masculinization surgery; 4 

(III) Liposuction; 5 

(IV) Lipofilling; 6 

(V) Pectoral implants; and 7 

(VI) Other aesthetic procedures; 8 

(11) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or 9 

product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product increases; and 10 

(12) It is of grave concern to this general assembly that the medical community is allowing 11 

individuals, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex, to be subjects of 12 

irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently 13 

sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that such 14 

extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure. In fact, they may 15 

increase the risk of suicide. 16 

SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled ""HEALTH AND SAFETY"" is hereby 17 

amended by adding thereto the following chapter: 18

Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose. 1 

The general assembly finds that: 2 

(1) Rhode Island has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of 3 

its citizens, especially vulnerable children;  4 

(2) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying 5 

with their biological sex;  6 

(3) For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience 7 

distress identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority 8 

come to embrace their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical 9 

physiological interventions unnecessary; 10 

(4) Scientific studies show that individuals experiencing distress identifying with their 11 

biological sex have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria, 12 

which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services; 13 

(5) Even among individuals who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment 14 

procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated 15 

above the background population; 16 

(6) Some healthcare professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs such as 17 

gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the natural onset or progression of 18 



 

 

 

LC004975 - Page 2 of 11 

puberty in children, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex: 1 

(i) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed, despite the lack of any long-term 2 

longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such 3 

distress or gender dysphoria; and 4 

(ii) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner 5 

on children; 6 

(7) Some healthcare professionals are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children 7 

who are experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact no randomized 8 

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in 9 

adults or children for the purpose of gender transition; 10 

(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks: 11 

(i) For biological females, some risks may include; 12 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 13 

(B) Severe liver dysfunction; 14 

(C) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 15 

(D) Increased risk of breast, cervical, and uterine cancers; 16 

(E) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; 17 

(F) Hypertension; 18 

(G) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; 19 

(H) Sleep apnea; 20 

(I) Type 2 diabetes; 21 

(J) Loss of bone density; 22 

(K) Destabilization of psychiatric disorders; and 23 

(ii) For biological males, some risks may include: 24 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 25 

(B) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; 26 

(C) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; 27 

(D) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 28 

(E) Type 2 diabetes; 29 

(F) Breast cancer; 30 

(G) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland; 31 

(H) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; and 32 

(I) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood; 33 

(9) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended 34 



 

 

 

LC004975 - Page 3 of 11 

for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming 1 

more frequent; 2 

(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures 3 

for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. 4 

These procedures are generally irreversible; 5 

(i) For biological males, surgery may involve: 6 

(A) Genital reconstruction, including a penectomy, which is the removal of the penis; 7 

(B) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles; 8 

(C) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a 9 

penile inversion procedure; 10 

(D) Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and 11 

(E) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure; 12 

(ii) For biological females, surgery may involve: 13 

(A) Hysterectomy or oophorectomy; 14 

(B) Reconstruction of the urethra; 15 

(C) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the 16 

construction of a penis-like structure; 17 

(D) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina; 18 

(E) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure; and 19 

(F) Implantation of erection and/or testicular prosthesis; 20 

(iii) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital sex 21 

reassignment surgery, for both males and females, are numerous and complex; 22 

(iv) Non-genital sex reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males 23 

and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically health, and functional body 24 

parts: 25 

(A) For biological males, this surgery may involve: 26 

(I) Augmentation mammoplasty; 27 

(II) Facial feminization surgery; 28 

(III) Liposuction; 29 

(IV) Lipofilling; 30 

(V) Voice feminization surgery; 31 

(VI) Thyroid cartilage reduction; 32 

(VII) Gluteal augmentation; 33 

(VIII) Hair reconstruction; and 34 



 

 

 

LC004975 - Page 4 of 11 

(IX) Other aesthetic procedures; 1 

(B) For biological females, this surgery may involve: 2 

(I) Subcutaneous mastectomy; 3 

(II) Voice masculinization surgery; 4 

(III) Liposuction; 5 

(IV) Lipofilling; 6 

(V) Pectoral implants; and 7 

(VI) Other aesthetic procedures; 8 

(11) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or 9 

product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product increases; and 10 

(12) It is of grave concern to this general assembly that the medical community is allowing 11 

individuals, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex, to be subjects of 12 

irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently 13 

sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that such 14 

extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure. In fact, they may 15 

increase the risk of suicide. 16 

SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled ""HEALTH AND SAFETY"" is hereby 17 

amended by adding thereto the following chapter: 18

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2024 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- RHODE ISLAND'S CHILDREN DESERVE 

HELP NOT HARM ACT -- MINOR'S GENDER TRANSITION 

Introduced By: Representatives P. Morgan, Quattrocchi, and Rea 

Date Introduced: March 04, 2024 

Referred To: House Health & Human Services 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose. 1 

The general assembly finds that: 2 

(1) Rhode Island has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of 3 

its citizens, especially vulnerable children;  4 

(2) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying 5 

with their biological sex;  6 

(3) For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience 7 

distress identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority 8 

come to embrace their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical 9 

physiological interventions unnecessary; 10 

(4) Scientific studies show that individuals experiencing distress identifying with their 11 

biological sex have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria, 12 

which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services; 13 

(5) Even among individuals who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment 14 

procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated 15 

above the background population; 16 

(6) Some healthcare professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs such as 17 

gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the natural onset or progression of 18 



 

 

 

LC005368 - Page 2 of 11 

puberty in children, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex: 1 

(i) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed, despite the lack of any long-term 2 

longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such 3 

distress or gender dysphoria; and 4 

(ii) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner 5 

on children; 6 

(7) Some healthcare professionals are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children 7 

who are experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact no randomized 8 

clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in 9 

adults or children for the purpose of gender transition; 10 

(8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks: 11 

(i) For biological females, some risks may include; 12 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 13 

(B) Severe liver dysfunction; 14 

(C) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 15 

(D) Increased risk of breast, cervical, and uterine cancers; 16 

(E) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; 17 

(F) Hypertension; 18 

(G) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; 19 

(H) Sleep apnea; 20 

(I) Type 2 diabetes; 21 

(J) Loss of bone density; 22 

(K) Destabilization of psychiatric disorders; and 23 

(ii) For biological males, some risks may include: 24 

(A) Irreversible infertility; 25 

(B) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; 26 

(C) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; 27 

(D) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; 28 

(E) Type 2 diabetes; 29 

(F) Breast cancer; 30 

(G) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland; 31 

(H) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; and 32 

(I) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood; 33 

(9) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended 34 



 

 

 

LC005368 - Page 3 of 11 

for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming 1 

more frequent; 2 

(10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures 3 

for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. 4 

These procedures are generally irreversible; 5 

(i) For biological males, surgery may involve: 6 

(A) Genital reconstruction, including a penectomy, which is the removal of the penis; 7 

(B) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles; 8 

(C) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a 9 

penile inversion procedure; 10 

(D) Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and 11 

(E) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure; 12 

(ii) For biological females, surgery may involve: 13 

(A) Hysterectomy or oophorectomy; 14 

(B) Reconstruction of the urethra; 15 

(C) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the 16 

construction of a penis-like structure; 17 

(D) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina; 18 

(E) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure; and 19 

(F) Implantation of erection and/or testicular prosthesis; 20 

(iii) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital sex 21 

reassignment surgery, for both males and females, are numerous and complex; 22 

(iv) Non-genital sex reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males 23 

and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically health, and functional body 24 

parts: 25 

(A) For biological males, this surgery may involve: 26 

(I) Augmentation mammoplasty; 27 

(II) Facial feminization surgery; 28 

(III) Liposuction; 29 

(IV) Lipofilling; 30 

(V) Voice feminization surgery; 31 

(VI) Thyroid cartilage reduction; 32 

(VII) Gluteal augmentation; 33 

(VIII) Hair reconstruction; and 34 



 

 

 

LC005368 - Page 4 of 11 

(IX) Other aesthetic procedures; 1 

(B) For biological females, this surgery may involve: 2 

(I) Subcutaneous mastectomy; 3 

(II) Voice masculinization surgery; 4 

(III) Liposuction; 5 

(IV) Lipofilling; 6 

(V) Pectoral implants; and 7 

(VI) Other aesthetic procedures; 8 

(11) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or 9 

product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product increases; and 10 

(12) It is of grave concern to this general assembly that the medical community is allowing 11 

individuals, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex, to be subjects of 12 

irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently 13 

sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that such 14 

extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure. In fact, they may 15 

increase the risk of suicide. 16 

SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled ""HEALTH AND SAFETY"" is hereby 17 

amended by adding thereto the following chapter: 18

Legislative findings and purpose. The general assembly finds that: (1) Rhode Island has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children; (2) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying with their biological sex; (3) For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to embrace their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical physiological interventions unnecessary; (4) Scientific studies show that individuals experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria, which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services; (5) Even among individuals who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population; (6) Some healthcare professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the natural onset or progression of puberty in children, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex: (i) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed, despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender dysphoria; and (ii) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner on children; (7) Some healthcare professionals are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who are experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of gender transition; (8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks: (i) For biological females, some risks may include; (A) Irreversible infertility; (B) Severe liver dysfunction; (C) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; (D) Increased risk of breast, cervical, and uterine cancers; (E) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; (F) Hypertension; (G) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells; (H) Sleep apnea; (I) Type 2 diabetes; (J) Loss of bone density; (K) Destabilization of psychiatric disorders; and (ii) For biological males, some risks may include: (A) Irreversible infertility; (B) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots; (C) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones; (D) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks; (E) Type 2 diabetes; (F) Breast cancer; (G) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland; (H) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; and (I) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood; (9) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent; (10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts. These procedures are generally irreversible; (i) For biological males, surgery may involve: (A) Genital reconstruction, including a penectomy, which is the removal of the penis; (B) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles; (C) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a penile inversion procedure; (D) Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and (E) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure; (ii) For biological females, surgery may involve: (A) Hysterectomy or oophorectomy; (B) Reconstruction of the urethra; (C) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the construction of a penis-like structure; (D) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina; (E) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure; and (F) Implantation of erection and/or testicular prosthesis; (iii) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital sex reassignment surgery, for both males and females, are numerous and complex; (iv) Non-genital sex reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and parts: (A) For biological males, this surgery may involve: (I) Augmentation mammoplasty; (II) Facial feminization surgery; (III) Liposuction; (IV) Lipofilling; (V) Voice feminization surgery; (VI) Thyroid cartilage reduction; (VII) Gluteal augmentation; (VIII) Hair reconstruction; (IX) Other aesthetic procedures; (B) For biological females, this surgery may involve: (I) Subcutaneous mastectomy; (II) Voice masculinization surgery; (III) Liposuction; (IV) Lipofilling; (V) Pectoral implants; and (VI) Other aesthetic procedures; (11) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product increases; and (12) It is of grave concern to this general assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex, to be subjects of irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that such extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure. In fact, they may increase the risk of suicide. SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled """"HEALTH AND SAFETY"""" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter: CHAPTER 104 RHODE ISLAND'S CHILDREN DESERVE HELP NOT HARM ACT 23-104-1.

-- RHODE ISLAND S CHILDREN DESERVE HELP NOT HARM ACT -- MINOR S GENDER TRANSITION Introduced By Senator E Morgan Date Introduced February Referred To Senate Health & Human Services It is <span class=""copied-language"">enacted by the General Assembly</span> as follows SECTION Legislative findings and purpose <span class=""copied-language"">The general assembly finds that</span> Rhode Island <span class=""copied-language"">has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of its citizens especially vulnerable children Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying with their biological sex For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress identifying with their biological sex studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to</span> embrace <span class=""copied-language"">their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood thereby rendering most</span> medical physiological interventions unnecessary <span class=""copied-language"">Scientific studies show that individuals</span> experiencing distress <span class=""copied-language"">identifying with their biological sex</span> have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services Even among individuals <span class=""copied-language"">who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures suicide rates psychiatric morbidities and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population Some healthcare</span> professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking <span class=""copied-language"">drugs such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in order to delay the</span> natural <span class=""copied-language"">onset or progression of puberty in children who experience distress identifying with their biological sex</span> Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed <span class=""copied-language"">despite the lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender</span> dysphoria and Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner on children Some healthcare professionals <span class=""copied-language"">are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who</span> are experiencing distress <span class=""copied-language"">identifying with their biological sex despite the fact no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of gender transition The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks</span> For biological females some risks may include Irreversible infertility <span class=""copied-language"">Severe liver dysfunction Coronary artery disease including heart attacks</span> Increased risk of breast cervical and uterine cancers <span class=""copied-language"">Cerebrovascular disease including strokes Hypertension Erythrocytosis which is an increase in red blood cells</span> Sleep apnea Type diabetes Loss of bone density Destabilization of psychiatric disorders and For biological males some risks may include Irreversible infertility <span class=""copied-language"">Thromboembolic disease including blood clots Cholelithiasis including gallstones Coronary artery disease including heart attacks</span> Type diabetes Breast cancer <span class=""copied-language"">Macroprolactinoma which is a tumor of the pituitary gland Cerebrovascular disease including strokes</span> and <span class=""copied-language"">Hypertriglyceridemia which is an elevated level of</span> triglycerides in the blood Genital and non-genital gender reassignment <span class=""copied-language"">for children although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts</span> These procedures are generally irreversible <span class=""copied-language"">For biological males surgery may involve Genital reconstruction including</span> a <span class=""copied-language"">penectomy which is the removal of the penis Orchiectomy which is the removal of the testicles Vaginoplasty which is the construction of a vagina-like structure typically through a penile inversion procedure Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure and Vulvoplasty which is the construction of a vulva-like structure For biological females surgery may involve</span> Hysterectomy or oophorectomy <span class=""copied-language"">Reconstruction of the urethra Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty which is the construction of a penis-like structure Vaginectomy which is the removal of the vagina Scrotoplasty which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure and Implantation of erection</span> and/or testicular prosthesis <span class=""copied-language"">The complications risks and long-term care concerns associated with genital</span> sex <span class=""copied-language"">reassignment surgery for both males and females are numerous and complex</span> Non-genital sex <span class=""copied-language"">reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males and females and parts For biological males this surgery may involve Augmentation mammoplasty Facial feminization surgery Liposuction Lipofilling Voice</span> feminization <span class=""copied-language"">surgery Thyroid cartilage reduction Gluteal augmentation Hair reconstruction Other aesthetic procedures For biological females this surgery may involve</span> Subcutaneous mastectomy Voice masculinization <span class=""copied-language"">surgery Liposuction Lipofilling Pectoral implants and Other aesthetic procedures It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or product is subsidized or reimbursed demand for that service or product</span> increases and <span class=""copied-language"">It is of grave concern to</span> this <span class=""copied-language"">general assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic</span> non-genital <span class=""copied-language"">gender reassignment surgery and irreversible permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment</span> surgeries <span class=""copied-language"">despite the lack of studies showing that</span> such extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure In fact they may increase the risk of suicide SECTION Title of the General Laws entitled
