67th Legislature HB 112.1
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 112
1 HOUSE BILL NO. 112
2 INTRODUCED BY J. FULLER
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT CREATING THE "SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT"; REQUIRING
5 PUBLIC SCHOOL ATHLETIC TEAMS TO BE DESIGNATED BASED ON BIOLOGICAL SEX; PROVIDING
6 CERTAIN PROTECTIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; PROVIDING A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR
7 CERTAIN VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.”

9 WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that there are "inherent differences between men and women", and
10 that these differences "remain cause for celebration but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for
11 artificial contracts on an individual's opportunity", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and
12 WHEREAS, these "inherent differences" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to
13 physiological differences; and
14 WHEREAS, men generally have "denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments" and "larger hearts,
15 greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher haemoglobin", Neel Burton, The
16 Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); and
17 WHEREAS, men have a higher natural level of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin
18 levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all
19 of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity, Doriane
20 Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, 80 Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata,
21 Men, Women, and Speed. 2 Words: Got Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); and
22 WHEREAS, the biological differences between males and females, especially as they relate to natural
23 levels of testosterone, "explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during
24 puberty and have life-long effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different
25 strength, speed, and endurance", Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, "Comparing Athletic
26 Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men," Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy; and
27 WHEREAS, while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the United States Supreme
28 Court has recognized that "sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic

1 disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of
2 the talent and capacities of our Nation's people", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and
3 WHEREAS, one place in which sex classification allows for the "full development of the talent and
4 capacities of our Nation's people" is in the context of sports and athletics; and
5 WHEREAS, courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and
6 females result in different athletic capabilities, see, e.g., Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc.,
7 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) ("Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly
8 situated as they enter athletic competition.") and Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct.
9 1979) (noting that high school boys generally possess physiological advantages over their girl counterparts and
10 that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like high school track); and
11 WHEREAS, a recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although
12 athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the gender gap between male and female performances
13 remained stable, which "suggest[s] that women's performances at the high level will never match those of men",
14 Valerie Thibault, et al., Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9
15 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); and
16 WHEREAS, as Duke Law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Lambelet Coleman, tennis
17 champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently wrote, "The
18 evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will
19 always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head
20 competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science", Doriane Lambelet Coleman, et al., Pass the
21 Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); and
22 WHEREAS, having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality, and sex23 specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength,
24 and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college
25 scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.
