HOUSE BILL NO. 112 1 

INTRODUCED BY J. FULLER 2 

 3 

A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT CREATING THE ""SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT""; REQUIRING 4 

PUBLIC SCHOOL ATHLETIC TEAMS TO BE DESIGNATED BASED ON BIOLOGICAL SEX; PROVIDING 5 

CERTAIN PROTECTIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; PROVIDING A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR 6 

CERTAIN VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.” 7 

 8 

WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that there are ""inherent differences between men and women"", and 9 

that these differences ""remain cause for celebration but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for 10 

artificial contracts on an individual's opportunity"", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and 11 

WHEREAS, these ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 12 

physiological differences; and 13 

WHEREAS, men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 14 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher haemoglobin"", Neel Burton, The 15 

Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); and 16 

WHEREAS, men have a higher natural level of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin 17 

levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all 18 

of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity, Doriane 19 

Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, 80 Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, 20 

Men, Women, and Speed. 2 Words: Got Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); and 21 

WHEREAS, the biological differences between males and females, especially as they relate to natural 22 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during 23 

puberty and have life-long effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different 24 

strength, speed, and endurance"", Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic 25 

Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy; and 26 

WHEREAS, while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the United States Supreme 27 

Court has recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 28 



 
  
67th Legislature  HB 112.1

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of 1 

the talent and capacities of our Nation's people"", United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); and 2 

WHEREAS, one place in which sex classification allows for the ""full development of the talent and 3 

capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics; and 4 

WHEREAS, courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 5 

females result in different athletic capabilities, see, e.g., Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 6 

612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly 7 

situated as they enter athletic competition."") and Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 8 

1979) (noting that high school boys generally possess physiological advantages over their girl counterparts and 9 

that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like high school track); and 10 

WHEREAS, a recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although 11 

athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the gender gap between male and female performances 12 

remained stable, which ""suggest[s] that women's performances at the high level will never match those of men"", 13 

Valerie Thibault, et al., Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 14 

Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010); and 15 

WHEREAS, as Duke Law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Lambelet Coleman, tennis 16 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently wrote, ""The 17 

evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will 18 

always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head 19 

competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science"", Doriane Lambelet Coleman, et al., Pass the 20 

Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); and 21 

WHEREAS, having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality, and sex-22 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, 23 

and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college 24 

scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors. 25

Introduced

House Bill 2676

By Delegate Westfall

[Introduced February 23, 2021; Referred to the Committee on Education]

A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new section, designated §18-9A-27, relating to requiring, for an official or unofficial school-sanctioned athletic or sporting event, that each athlete’s participation in the athletic or sporting event be based on the athlete’s biological sex as indicated on the athlete’s original birth certificate issued at the time of birth; providing a revised designation for sporting events; and providing a means by which civil actions can be taken.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia:


ARTICLE 9A. Public school support.


§18-9A-27. Clarifying Participation for Sports Events to Be Based on Biological Sex of the Athlete at Birth.


(a) Legislative findings. - 

(1) The Legislature finds that there are “inherent differences between men and women,” and that these differences “remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity,” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);

(2) These “inherent differences” range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences;

(3) Men generally have “denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments” and “larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,” Neel Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012);

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008));

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural levels of testosterone, “explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,” Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, “Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,” Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy;

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has recognized that “sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people,” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the “full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people” is in the context of sports and athletics;

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 13 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (“Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition.”); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that “high school boys [generally possess physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts” and that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like “high school track”);

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the “gender gap” between female and male performances remained stable. “These suggest that women's performances at the high level will never match those of men.” Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 (2010);

(10) As Duke Law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently wrote: “The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,” Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019);

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that even “after 12 months of hormonal therapy,” a man who identifies as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones “had an absolute advantage” over female athletes and “will still likely have performance benefits” over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., “Muscle strength, size and composition following months of gender-affirming treatment in transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,” Karolinksa Institute (Sept. 26, 2019); and

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors.

(b) Designation of Athletic Teams. --

(1) Interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports that are sponsored by a public school or any school that is a member of the West Virginia high school activities association or a public institution of higher education or any higher education institution that is a member of the national collegiate athletic association (NCAA), national association of intercollegiate athletics (NAIA), or national junior college athletic association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one (1) of the following based on biological ex:

(A) Males, men, or boys;

(B) Females, women, or girls; or

(C) Coed or mixed.

(2) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to students of the male sex.

(3) If disputed, a student may establish sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex based solely on:

(A) The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy;

(B) The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone;

(C) An analysis of the student's genetic makeup.

(d) Protection for Educational Institutions. --

A government entity, any licensing or accrediting organization, or any athletic association or organization shall not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse action against a school or an institution of higher education for maintaining separate interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex.

(e) Cause of Action. --

(1) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher education.

(2) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, institution of higher education, or athletic association or organization as a result of reporting a violation of this chapter to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or organization.

(3) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the government entity, licensing or accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization.

(4) All civil actions must be initiated within two years after the harm occurred. Persons or organizations who prevail on a claim brought pursuant to this section shall be entitled to monetary damages, including for any psychological, emotional, and physical harm suffered, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, and any other appropriate relief.

 

NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require that each athlete’s participation in the athletic or sporting event be based on the athlete’s biological sex as indicated on the athlete’s original birth certificate issued at the time of birth.

(a) The General Assembly finds as follows:

        between the sexes under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Section 1681 et seq.).

(b) The purpose of this chapter is to do all of the following:

(1) Provide opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities

        numerous other long-term benefits that result from success in athletic endeavors.

(2) Promote sex equality by requiring the designation of separate sex-specific athletic teams or sports.

        system of vocational or technical education.

6		(105 ILCS 5/27-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 27-1)
7		Sec. 27-1. Areas of education taught - discrimination on
8		account of sex. The State of Illinois, having the

16		development and health.
17		Each school district shall give priority in the allocation
18		of resources, including funds, time allocation, personnel, and
19		facilities, to fulfilling the primary purpose of schooling.
20		The State Board of Education shall establish goals and
21		learning standards consistent with the above purposes and

17		comparable programs supported from school district funds. For
18		the purposes of this Section, a statement of a student's
19		biological sex on the student's official birth certificate is

12		the boys' tournaments. Except as specifically stated in this
13		Section, equal access to programs supported by school district
14		funds and comparable programs will be defined in rules

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2022 

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senators E Morgan, and Lombardo 

Date Introduced: March 01, 2022 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) The legislature finds that there are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and 2 

that these differences ""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either 3 

sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 4 

515, 533 (1996); 5 

(2) These ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 6 

physiological differences; 7 

(3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 8 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel 9 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 10 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 11 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 12 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 13 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 14 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 15 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 16 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 17 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 18 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 19

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 1 

Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law 2 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 3 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 4 

recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 5 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 6 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 7 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 8 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the ""full development of the talent and 9 

capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics; 10 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 11 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 12 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys 13 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 14 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that ""high school boys [generally possess 15 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those advantages give them an 16 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high school track""); 17 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 18 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female 19 

and male performances remained stable. ""These suggest that women's performances at the high 20 

level will never match those of men."" Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 21 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 22 

(2010); 23 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 24 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 25 

wrote: ""The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 26 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 27 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,"" 28 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 29 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 30 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 31 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 32 

treatments found that even ""after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy,"" a man who identifies 33 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over female athletes and 34 



 

 

 

LC004598 - Page 3 of 5 

""will still likely have performance benefits"" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., ""Muscle 1 

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 2 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 3 

2019); and 4 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-5 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 6 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 7 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 8 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 9 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled ""EDUCATION"" is hereby amended by 10 

adding thereto the following chapter: 11 

CHAPTER 112  12 

FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 13

EXPLANATION 

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team must be categorized as males, men, or boys; 2 

females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute a student may establish sex by 3 

presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, this act 4 

would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or subject 5 

to retaliation as a result of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2023.  7

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1

""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2024.  7

THIRTY-SECOND LEGISLATURE, 2023

 

STATE OF HAWAII

 

 

 

 

 

 

A BILL FOR AN ACT

 

 

relating to sex-specific student athletic teams.

 

 

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:

 


     SECTION 1. The legislature finds that it is both proper and healthy for a society to maintain opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that result from success in athletic endeavors.

     The legislature also finds that in recent years, the question of transgender athletes competing against biologically opposite genders has stirred controversies across the nation, with male-to-female transgender athletes winning events ranging from girls state high school championship titles, to a womens NCAA 500-yard freestyle swimming event.

     The legislature further finds there is a dire need to promote sex equality by ensuring that female athletes have a designated space to compete against other females. While it has become part of a national conversation, the legislature finds that for this particular issue, the male and female designation is to mean biological male and biological female, respectively.

     The purpose of this Act is to require the designation of separate sex-specific athletic teams or sports.

     SECTION 2. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be properly designated and to read as follows:

     ""§302A-  Sex-specific athletic teams. (a) There is a requirement to designate separate sex-specific athletic teams or sports within interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, and club athletic teams or sports. These include sports teams sponsored by a public, primary or secondary school, a public postsecondary institution, or any school or institution whose students or teams compete against a public school or public postsecondary institution. These teams shall be expressly designated as one of the following based on biological sex:

     (1) Males, men, or boys;

     (2) Females, women, or girls; or

     (3) Coed or mixed.

     (b) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male sex.

     (c) A dispute regarding a student's sex shall be resolved by the student's school or institution by requesting that the student provide a health examination and consent form or other statement signed by the student's personal health care provider which must verify the student's biological sex. The health care provider may verify the student's biological sex as part of a routine sports physical examination by relying on only one or more of the following:

     (1) The student's reproductive anatomy;

     (2) The student's genetic makeup; or

     (3) The student's normal endogenously produced testosterone levels.

     (d) The State Board of Education shall adopt rules regarding the receipt and timely resolution of disputes by schools and institutions consistent with this subsection.""

     SECTION 3. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be properly designated and to read as follows:

     ""§302A-  Protection for educational institutions. (a) A governmental entity, any licensing or accrediting organization, or any athletic association or organization may not entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse action against any school or public postsecondary institution for maintaining separate interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex.""

     SECTION 4. Chapter 302A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to be properly designated and to read as follows:

     ""§302A-   Cause of action, civil remedies. (a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this section shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or public postsecondary institution.

     (b) Any student who is subject to retaliation or other adverse action by a school, postsecondary institution, or athletic association or organization as a result of reporting a violation of this section to an employee or representative of the school, institution, or athletic association or organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or public postsecondary institutions in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or organization.

     (c) Any school or public postsecondary institution that suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this section shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the governmental entity, licensing or accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization.

     (d) All civil actions brought under this section must be initiated within two years after the alleged harm occurred. Persons or organizations who prevail on a claim brough under this section shall be entitled to monetary damages, including for any psychological, emotional, or physical harm suffered, reasonable attorney fees and costs, and any other appropriate relief.""

     SECTION 5.  New statutory material is underscored.

     SECTION 6.  This Act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and proceedings that were begun before its effective date.

     SECTION 7.  If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.

     SECTION 8.  This Act shall take effect upon its approval.

§23.1-408.2. Intercollegiate, intramural, and club athletic teams and sports; designation of teams; student participation.

A. Each intercollegiate, intramural, and club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by a public institution of higher education or any institution of higher education that is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), or National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) shall be expressly designated as one of the following based on the biological sex of the students who participate on the team or in the sport:

1. For ""males,"" ""men,"" or ""boys"";

2. For ""females,"" ""women,"" or ""girls""; or

3. For ""coed"" or ""mixed,"" if participation on such team or sport is open to both (i) males, men, or boys and (ii) females, women, or girls.

B. Each intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team or sport that is sponsored by any such institution of higher education and that is expressly designated for ""females,"" ""women,"" or ""girls"" pursuant to subsection A shall not be open to any student of the male sex.

C. If the biological sex of any such student seeking to participate on such an expressly designated team is disputed, such student may establish biological sex by presenting to the administration of the institution, or such other authority designated by such institution for such purpose, a signed physician's statement that shall attest to the student's biological sex based solely on:

1. The student's internal and external reproductive anatomy;

2. The student's normal endogenously produced levels of testosterone; and

3. An analysis of the student's genetic makeup.

D. No government entity, licensing or accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization shall entertain a complaint, open an investigation, or take any other adverse action against an institution of higher education for explicitly designating or maintaining separate intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for ""females, ""women,"" or ""girls"" pursuant to subsections A, B, and C. Any institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a violation of this section shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against such government entity, licensing or accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization.

E. Any student who is (i) deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect harm as a result of a knowing violation of this section by any such institution of higher education or (ii) subject to retaliation or other adverse action by an institution of higher education, athletic association, or organization as a result of reporting a violation of this section to an employee or representative of such institution, athletic association, or organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of such institution in the Commonwealth, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against such institution, athletic association, or organization.

F. The provisions of subsections D and E shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.

G. All civil actions brought pursuant to subsection D or E must be initiated within two years after the harm occurred. Any person who prevails on a claim brought pursuant to this section shall be entitled to monetary damages, including for any psychological, emotional, and physical harm suffered, reasonable attorney fees and costs, and any other appropriate relief.

2. That the General Assembly finds that (i) there are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these differences ""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity"" (United States v. Virginia 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)), and these ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to physiological differences, including men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments,"" ""larger hearts, greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin"" (Neel Burton, ""The Battle of the Sexes,"" Psychology Today (July 2, 2012)), higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of type two muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power during physical activity (Doriane Lambelet Coleman, ""Sex in Sport,"" Law and Contemporary Problems 63, 74 (2017)); (ii) that these biological differences between men and women ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: categorically different strength, speed and endurance"" (Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law Center for Sports Law and Policy), and that while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people"" (United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996)); (iii) that one place in which sex classifications allow for the ""full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics (Id.); (iv) that courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic capabilities, as seen in Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992):""Because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."" and in Petrie v. Illinois High Sch. Ass'n, 394 N.E. 2d 855, 861 (Ill. Ct. App. 1979): finding that ""high school boys [generally possess physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those advantages give them an unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high school track""; (v) that a recent study of female and male Olympic performances dating back to 1983 found that, although athletes of both sexes improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female and male performances remains stable and ""[t]h[is] suggest[s] that women's performances at the high level will never match those of men"" (Valerie Thibault et al., ""Women and Men in Sport Performance: The Gender Gap Has Not Evolved since 1983,"" Journal of Sports Science & Medicine 214, 291 (2010)); (vi) that, as Duke Law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross wrote, ""[t]he evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science."" (Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., ""Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX,"" Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019)); and (vii) that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that even ""after 12 months of hormonal therapy"" a man who identifies as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over female athletes and ""will still likely have performance benefits"" over women (Tommy Lundberg, et al., ""Muscle strength, size and composition following months of gender-affirming treatment of transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinska Institute (Sept. 26, 2019)); and that the General Assembly finds that having sex-specific teams provide opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors, and that, therefore, maintaining separate sex-specific teams is imperative to promoting sex equality and necessary to ensuring female athletes equal protection under the law and equal treatment and opportunity in public school and higher education athletics.",2024-01-19,text/html,1,"<p>SENATE BILL NO Offered January A BILL to

____________ 

 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

Introduced By: Senator E Morgan 

Date Introduced: March 01, 2024 

Referred To: Senate Judiciary 

 

 

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows: 

SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that: 1 

(1) There are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these differences 2 

""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial 3 

constraints on an individual's opportunity,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 4 

(2) These ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to 5 

physiological differences; 6 

(3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts, 7 

greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel 8 

Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012); 9 

(4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as 10 

hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of 11 

type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power 12 

during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary 13 

Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got 14 

Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008)); 15 

(5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural 16 

levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop 17 

during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport: 18 

categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 19

Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law 1 

Center for Sports Law and Policy; 2 

(6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has 3 

recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic 4 

disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full 5 

development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 6 

U.S. 515, 533 (1996); 7 

(7) One place where sex classifications allow for the ""full development of the talent and 8 

capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics; 9 

(8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and 10 

females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic 11 

League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys 12 

and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 13 

394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that ""high school boys [generally possess 14 

physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those advantages give them an 15 

unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high school track""); 16 

(9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that, 17 

although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female 18 

and male performances remained stable. ""These suggest that women's performances at the high 19 

level will never match those of men."" Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance: 20 

The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219 21 

(2010); 22 

(10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis 23 

champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently 24 

wrote: ""The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting, 25 

and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls 26 

and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,"" 27 

Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX, 28 

Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019); 29 

(11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished 30 

through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such 31 

treatments found that even ""after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy,"" a man who identifies 32 

as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over female athletes and 33 

""will still likely have performance benefits"" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., ""Muscle 34

strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in 1 

transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26, 2 

2019); and 3 

(12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex-4 

specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their 5 

skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain 6 

recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that 7 

flow from success in athletic endeavors. 8 

SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled ""EDUCATION"" is hereby amended by 9 

adding thereto the following chapter: 10 

CHAPTER 114  11

OF 

A N   A C T 

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT 

***

This act would categorize women by their biological identity at birth rather than their 1 

gender identity for purpose of organized sports. A team would be categorized as males, men, or 2 

boys; females, women, or girls; or coed or mixed. If there is a dispute, a student would establish 3 

sex by presenting a signed physician's statement that shall indicate the student's sex. Additionally, 4 

this act would create a cause of action for any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or 5 

subject to retaliation as a result of violations of this chapter. 6 

This act would take effect January 1, 2025.  7

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT
Introduced By: Senator E Morgan
Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that:
2 (1) There are ""inherent differences between men and women,"" and that these differences
3 ""remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial
4 constraints on an individual's opportunity,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);
5 (2) These ""inherent differences"" range from chromosomal and hormonal differences to
6 physiological differences;
7 (3) Men generally have ""denser, stronger bones, tendons, and ligaments"" and ""larger hearts,
8 greater lung volume per body mass, a higher red blood cell count, and higher hemoglobin,"" Neel
9 Burton, The Battle of the Sexes, Psychology Today (July 2, 2012);
10 (4) Men also have higher natural levels of testosterone, which affects traits such as
11 hemoglobin levels, body fat content, the storage and use of carbohydrates, and the development of
12 type 2 muscle fibers, all of which result in men being able to generate higher speed and power
13 during physical activity, Doriane Lambelet Coleman, Sex in Sport, Law and Contemporary
14 Problems 63, 74 (2017) (quoting Gina Kolata, Men, Women and Speed. 2 Words: Got
15 Testosterone?, N.Y. Times (Aug. 21, 2008));
16 (5) The biological differences between females and males, especially as it relates to natural
17 levels of testosterone, ""explain the male and female secondary sex characteristics which develop
18 during puberty and have lifelong effects, including those most important for success in sport:
19 categorically different strength, speed, and endurance,"" Doriane Lambelet Coleman and Wickliffe 
LC000384 - Page 2 of 5
1 Shreve, ""Comparing Athletic Performances: The Best Elite Women to Boys and Men,"" Duke Law
2 Center for Sports Law and Policy;
3 (6) While classifications based on sex are generally disfavored, the Supreme Court has
4 recognized that ""sex classifications may be used to compensate women for particular economic
5 disabilities [they have] suffered, to promote equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full
6 development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people,"" United States v. Virginia, 518
7 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);
8 (7) One place where sex classifications allow for the ""full development of the talent and
9 capacities of our Nation's people"" is in the context of sports and athletics;
10 (8) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and
11 females result in different athletic capabilities. See e.g. Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic
12 League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992) (""Because of innate physiological differences, boys
13 and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition."");Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n,
14 394 N.E.2d 855, 861 (Ill. App. Ct. 1979) (noting that ""high school boys [generally possess
15 physiological advantages over] their girl counterparts"" and that those advantages give them an
16 unfair lead over girls in some sports like ""high school track"");
17 (9) A recent study of female and male Olympic performances since 1983 found that,
18 although athletes from both sexes improved over the time span, the ""gender gap"" between female
19 and male performances remained stable. ""These suggest that women's performances at the high
20 level will never match those of men."" Valerie Thibault et al., Women and men in sport performance:
21 The gender gap has not evolved since 1983, 9 Journal of Sports Science and Medicine 214, 219
22 (2010);
23 (10) As Duke law professor and All-American track athlete Doriane Coleman, tennis
24 champion Martina Navratilova, and Olympic track gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross recently
25 wrote: ""The evidence is unequivocal that starting in puberty, in every sport except sailing, shooting,
26 and riding, there will always be significant numbers of boys and men who would beat the best girls
27 and women in head-to-head competition. Claims to the contrary are simply a denial of science,""
28 Doriane Coleman, Martina Navratilova, et al., Pass the Equality Act, But Don't Abandon Title IX,
29 Washington Post (Apr. 29, 2019);
30 (11) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished
31 through the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. A recent study on the impact of such
32 treatments found that even ""after twelve (12) months of hormonal therapy,"" a man who identifies
33 as a woman and is taking cross-sex hormones ""had an absolute advantage"" over female athletes and
34 ""will still likely have performance benefits"" over women, Tommy Lundberg et al., ""Muscle 
LC000384 - Page 3 of 5
1 strength, size and composition following twelve (12) months of gender-affirming treatment in
2 transgender individuals: retained advantage for the transwomen,"" Karolinksa Institutet (Sept. 26,
3 2019); and
4 (12) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to promote sex equality. Sex5 specific teams accomplish this by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their
6 skill, strength, and athletic abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain
7 recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the numerous other long-term benefits that
8 flow from success in athletic endeavors.
9 SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled ""EDUCATION"" is hereby amended by
10 adding thereto the following chapter:
11 CHAPTER 117
12 FAIRNESS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS ACT
13 16-117-1. Short title.

23 (2) Females, women, or girls; or
24 (3) Coed or mixed.
25 (i) Athletic teams or sports designated for females, women, or girls shall not be open to

2 intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sports for students of the female sex.
3 16-117-4. Cause of action.
4 (a) Any student who is deprived of an athletic opportunity or suffers any direct or indirect
5 harm as a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive
6 relief, damages, and any other relief available under law against the school or institution of higher
7 education.

11 organization, or to any state or federal agency with oversight of schools or institutions of higher
12 education in the state, shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief, damages, and any
13 other relief available under law against the school, institution, or athletic association or
14 organization.
15 (c) Any school or institution of higher education that suffers any direct or indirect harm as
16 a result of a violation of this chapter shall have a private cause of action for injunctive relief,

18 accrediting organization, or athletic association or organization.
19 (d) All civil actions shall be initiated within two (2) years after the harm occurred. Persons
20 or organizations who prevail on a claim brought pursuant to this section shall be entitled to
21 monetary damages, including for any psychological, emotional, and physical harm suffered,
22 reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and any other appropriate relief.
23 16-117-5. Severability.
24 The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of

26 for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this
27 chapter.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to athletics; requiring certain schools and
institutions of higher education to designate by sex the
athletic teams and sports sponsored by the schools or
institutions; prohibiting male or female athletes from
competing on teams designated for the other sex;
prohibiting certain actions from being brought against a
school or institution for maintaining a separate athletic
team or sport designated for pupils and students of the
female or male sex; establishing certain causes of action;
establishing the statute of limitations for such actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs athletics in schools and in institutions of higher education.
2 (Chapters 385B and 398 of NRS) Section 5 of this bill requires a public school or a
3 private school that competes against a public school to designate, based on
4 biological sex at birth, each athletic team or sport that is sponsored by the school as
5 being for males, for females or for both males and females. Section 5 prohibits
6 such a school from opening an athletic team or sport that is designated for females
7 or males to participation by members of the other sex. Section 6 of this bill
8 provides that a school’s compliance with section 5 does not constitute
9 discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity or expression under any state
10 statute or local ordinance. Section 6 also prohibits certain entities that oversee
11 athletic teams and sports that are sponsored by public schools from taking certain
12 adverse actions against a school for maintaining a separate athletic team or sport for
13 females or males. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill establish similar provisions
14 applicable to public and private institutions of higher education. Sections 3, 4 and
15 9 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the
16 applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4.
– 2 –
- *SB112*
17 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a pupil to bring a civil action against: (1) a
18 school for a violation of sections 2-7; or (2) a school or athletic association or
19 organization for retaliating against the pupil for reporting a violation of sections 2-
20 7 to the school, athletic association or organization or a state or federal agency with
21 oversight of the school. Section 7 additionally authorizes a school to bring a civil
22 action against a governmental entity, licensing or accrediting organization or
23 athletic association or organization for a violation of sections 2-7. Section 7
24 establishes: (1) the period within which such a civil action must be filed; and (2) the
25 types of relief available in such a civil action. Section 12 of this bill establishes
26 similar provisions applicable to public and private institutions of higher education.
1 WHEREAS, In 2018, Communicative & Integrative Biology
2 published an article titled “Only two sex forms but multiple gender
3 variants: How to explain?” which stated that “with respect to
4 biological sex, one is either male or female”; and
5 WHEREAS, In 2021, BJPsych Bulletin published an article titled
6 “Sex, gender and gender identity: a re-evaluation of the evidence,”
7 which explained that the sex of a natural person “is determined at
8 fertili[z]ation and revealed at birth or, increasingly, in utero”; and
9 WHEREAS, In 2012, Chromosome Research published an article
10 titled “Mammalian sex determination-insights from humans and
11 mice,” which stated that “biological differences between males and
12 females are determined genetically during embryonic development”;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, In 2021, Sports Medicine published an article titled
15 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
16 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage,” which
17 asserted that the “[s]econdary sex characteristics that develop during
18 puberty . . . generate anatomical divergence beyond the reproductive
19 system, leading to adult body types that are measurably different
20 between sexes”; and
21 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has declared there
22 are inherent differences between men and women and these
23 differences are “cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the
24 members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s
25 opportunity” (United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996));
26 and
27 WHEREAS, In 2016, the European Journal of Sport Science
28 published an article titled “Physical fitness normative values for 6-
29 18-year-old Greek boys and girls, using the empirical distribution
30 and the lambda, mu, and sigma statistical method” and in 2011, the
31 British Journal of Sports Medicine published an article titled
32 “Normative health-related fitness values for children: Analysis of
33 85347 test results on 9-17-year-old Australians since 1985,” which
34 discussed studies of large cohorts of children who were between 6
35 and 19 years of age and found that boys typically scored higher than 
– 3 –
- *SB112*
1 girls on cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular
2 endurance and speed and agility but lower on flexibility; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2017, the International Journal of Sports
4 Physiology and Performance published an article titled “Sex
5 Differences in World Record Performance: The Influence of Sport
6 Discipline and Competition Duration,” which concluded that the
7 physiological differences between males and females that are
8 relevant to performance in sports “include a larger body size with
9 more skeletal muscle mass, a lower percentage of body fat, as well
10 as greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy”; and
11 WHEREAS, In 2017, Law and Contemporary Problems
12 published an article titled “Sex in Sport” that explained that men
13 having higher natural levels of testosterone is significant because it
14 affects traits such as “hemoglobin levels, body fat content, ‘the
15 absolute ability to store and use carbohydrate,’ and the development
16 of ‘Type 2 muscle fibers, which are used to generate speed and
17 power’ ”; and
18 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
19 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
20 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
21 explained that there is a gap between males and females with regard
22 to performance in sports such that the physiological advantages
23 conferred on males by biological sex “appear, on assessment of
24 performance data, [to be] insurmountable”; and
25 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has also declared
26 that while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored,
27 “[s]ex classifications may be used to compensate women for
28 particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promot[e]
29 equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development
30 of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people” (United States v.
31 Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (alteration in original) (internal
32 citations and quotations omitted); and
33 WHEREAS, One area where sex classifications allow for the full
34 development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people is in
35 the context of sports and athletics; and
36 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of Rhode Island and the Illinois
37 Fourth District Appeals Court have recognized that the inherent,
38 physiological differences between males and females result in
39 different athletic capabilities (Kleczek v. R.I. Interscholastic League,
40 Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n,
41 394 N.E.2d 855, 861); and
42 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
43 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
44 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
45 explained that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to male 
– 4 –
- *SB112*
1 athletes are not significantly diminished through the use of
2 testosterone suppression; and
3 WHEREAS, That article found that policies like those of the
4 International Olympic Committee requiring biological males to
5 undergo at least 1 year of testosterone suppression before competing
6 in women’s sports do not create a level playing field; and
7 WHEREAS, That article concluded that the reduction in
8 testosterone levels required by policies like those of the
9 International Olympic Committee “is insufficient to remove or
10 reduce the male advantage, in terms of muscle mass and strength, by
11 any meaningful degree”; and
12 WHEREAS, That article concluded “that superior anthropometric,
13 muscle mass and strength parameters achieved by males at puberty,
14 and underpinning a considerable portion of the male performance
15 advantage over females, are not removed by the current regimen of
16 testosterone suppression” permitted by the International Olympic
17 Committee and other sports organizations; and
18 WHEREAS, That article instead found that “male performance
19 advantage remains substantial” and “raises obvious concerns about
20 fair and safe competition”; and
21 WHEREAS, Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to
22 promote equality between the sexes by providing opportunities for
23 female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and athletic
24 abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain
25 recognition, accolades, college scholarships and the numerous other
26 long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors; and
27 WHEREAS, If males were permitted to compete in female sports,
28 the risk of injury to females would be increased by the ability of a
29 biological male to exert greater force, strength and power, and also
30 by females’ reduced ability to receive or tolerate that force; and
31 WHEREAS, Separating participants in contact sports based on
32 biological sex promotes the safety of female athletes by protecting
33 them from predictable and preventable injuries caused by male
34 athletes; now, therefore,
35
